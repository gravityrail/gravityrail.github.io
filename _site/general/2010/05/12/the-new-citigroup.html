<p class="meta">12 May 2010</p>

<div class="post">
<p>As part of its ongoing PR-ification of the financial crisis, Citigroup has posted the hilariously tautological &quot;<a href="http://new.citi.com/2010/02/a-safer-approach-to-risk.shtml">A Safer Approach to Risk</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quote from the article:
<blockquote>
For our society to function efficiently, capital needs to flow. But the attendant risk must be better managed. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve strengthened our commitment to responsible finance.
</blockquote></p>

<p>And here&#39;s another notable quote from recent history:</p>

<blockquote>
"as long as the music is playing, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got to get up and dance. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re still dancing."
    -Citi Chief on Buyouts: &acirc;&euro;&tilde;We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re Still Dancing&acirc;&euro;&trade;, DealBook, July 2007
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly how much of that culture has actually changed? You can revamp how you do business, but it&#39;s not just Citi that&#39;s broken. It&#39;s the entire culture and machinery of top-tier capitalism. They may be chagrined, but that is only temporary.</p>

<p>Profit through obfuscation. Profit through leveraging the power that money provides. Profit through PR.</p>

<p>Why not profit through generating value? How about that for a change? Sheesh. I&#39;m sick of financial companies that treat business like a giant card trick.</p>

<p>In other words, I remain to be convinced...</p>
