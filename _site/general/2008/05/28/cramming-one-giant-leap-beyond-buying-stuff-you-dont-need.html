<p class="meta">28 May 2008</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Cramming. You&#39;ve heard of spamming, phishing, and pharming (<a href="http://urbandictionary.com">or have you</a>?). Welcome to the latest unwanted and insidious confidence trick that allows people to bill you recurrently <em>for stuff you never asked for</em>.</p>

<p>According to a well-rounded <a href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/cram-this.ars">Ars-Technica article</a>, cramming involves signing up a mobile phone user to services which directly bill their mobile phone account without them ever knowing you did it.</p>

<p>But wait - how can someone do this without your permission? Well, apparently they can. And the mobile phone companies don&#39;t seem to care. They simply assume you authorised the third party to bill your account.</p>

<p>So if you see repeated bills for $12.95-ish for services on your account with innocuous names like &quot;Orbit Telecom&quot; or &quot;MyIProducts IMail&quot;, look deeper - you may have been crammed. It&#39;s about as pleasant as it sounds.</p>

<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/cram-this.ars">Read the article</a> for a better description than I could give here.</p>

<p>(caution: Urban Dictionary doesn&#39;t appear to have caught up yet: They still define cramming as &quot;<em>Un-lubed Ass-banging</em>&quot;. You have been warned)</p>
