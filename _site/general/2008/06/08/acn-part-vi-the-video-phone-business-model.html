                <h2>ACN part VI: The video phone business model</h2>
<p class="meta">08 Jun 2008</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I finally found <a href="http://www.getvideophone.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=46&Itemid=99">the specifications</a> for the Iris 2000 video phone that ACN is trumpeting as the Next Big Thing (tm).</p>

<p>It turns out - it does use SIP! Halleluyah. And H.263, and all the other IETF-recommended standards.</p>

<p>The same standards supported by:
- <a href="http://www.neobits.com/leadtek_bvp_8762_sip_videophone_p9875.html">Leadtek</a>
- <a href="http://www.grandstream.com/gxv3000.html">Grandstream</a> ($299, which has far better protocol support including H.264)
- <a href="http://www.neobits.com/d-link_dvc-2000_broadband_desktop_videophone_p9873.html">D-Link</a>
- <a href="http://www.alibaba.com/showroom/Video_Phone.html">Many, many more</a></p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>The difference?</p>

<p>ACN&#39;s video phone is barely mentioned anywhere on the web, despite it essentially offering the same features as those other phones. Google &quot;SIP video phone&quot; and you&#39;ll be taken to <a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/SIP+Video+Phones">voip-info.org</a>, whose video phone directly lists all the major players.</p>

<p>ACN isn&#39;t there.</p>

<p>If I was considering hitching my commercial wagon to a video conferencing company, which would I pick? One made by Cisco? Or Linksys? Or a company that doesn&#39;t even appear in the search results?</p>

<p>For a company that intends to become the &quot;biggest company in the world&quot;, this is a poor start.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more, there&#39;s no evidence that their video phone supports calling outside their own network.</p>

<p>In addition, this means that ACN&#39;s claim that their phone is based on &quot;proprietary technology&quot; is a lie. It&#39;s based on off-the-shelf, rebranded parts, probably sourced from the same factory in Taiwan that makes all the other video phones.</p>

<p>Nothing special here. Move on.</p>
