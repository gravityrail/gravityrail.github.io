                <h2>Fringe Show: Set List</h2>
<p class="meta">24 Sep 2008</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Greetings Evildoers,</p>

<p>As occasionally happens, I have a show in Fringe. This time it&#39;s an improvised musical show -- we create a new band at that the beginning of the show from audience suggestions, and then play a whole gig as that band. The music is rehearsed, but the lyrics are improvised based on our interaction with the audience. It&#39;s a truly unique new form of theater, and we really enjoy playing it.</p>

<p>Each week is a different genre, so you can <strong>come along to all 3</strong> if you like! ;-)</p>

<p>For this event we&#39;ve assembled some of the finest improvisors and musicians in Melbourne to play our 3 debut genres: Folk, Jazz and Rock. We&#39;ve got members of folk ensembles, orchestras, music theater shows, rock bands and more to create an improv supergroup that you will blow your mind.</p>

<p>The gigs are on Saturdays at 4:30pm at Trades Hall and run for about an hour:</p>

<ul>
    <li>27th September @ 4:30pm: Folk</li>
    <li>4th October @ 4:30pm: Jazz</li>
    <li>11th October @ 4:30pm: Rock</li>
</ul>

<p>Tickets are $15 full price, $12 concession. The theater is gorgeous, with 200 seats encircling the stage complete with Rolling Stones-style walkway. Oh yeah, baby! And of course in the same building there&#39;s the Bella Union Bar for drinks before and after the show.</p>

<p>Tickets are already selling fast, so book today through Melbourne Fringe (03 9660 9666), or online at <a href="http://www.melbournefringe.com.au/season/2008/show/174">http://www.melbournefringe.com.au/season/2008/show/174</a></p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and I hope to catch you all during Fringe.</p>
