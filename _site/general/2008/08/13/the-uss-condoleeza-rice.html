<p>This made me laugh in the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-kelly/i-want-condi_b_118598.html">Huffington Post</a>:
<blockquote>I don&#39;t believe Condoleezza Rice can actually play piano. Everything else she&#39;s ever touched has been a fraud and a catastrophe, why should her alleged musical abilities be any different? Think about it. Think about any event she&#39;s been even remotely involved in since you first heard her name. An endless string of threats and blundering and arrogant bluffs turned squalid pigfucks. It&#39;s not that she can&#39;t do her job; she can&#39;t do <em>anything</em>.  I think when she plays piano the piano catches fire and the audience dies.</blockquote>
Cynically: Is it because she&#39;s a black woman? We want <strong>so badly </strong>to believe that she&#39;s in her position on merit because it means that gender and/or race are longer barriers to the highest office.</p>

<p>Then again, maybe her failure is actually a validation that we&#39;ve moved yet further than that. Blacks, women, asians, transsexuals - there are so few barriers now that those who reach the highest office are just as mediocre as the old white men who&#39;ve monopolised those positions for centuries.</p>

<p>It kinda makes me feel good about the world. She&#39;s just another blinkered idiot in the White House.</p>

<p>Though, really, having an Exxon oil tanker named after you should have set a few alarm bells ringing when she first took office.</p>
