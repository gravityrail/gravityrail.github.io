<p>The Hotel could be the most interesting and inexplicable show that I&#39;ve ever been involved in - quite a feat considering the current record-holder in that regard was a 36-hour show in which a fictional two-state country was invented and then one state seceded from the republic because Mark Watson wouldn&#39;t pop up the road and buy a webcam. Meanwhile somebody flew across the world and we sang more than a few rousing songs.</p>

<p>But I digress. The Hotel is a mind-bending new comedy directed by Mark Watson which tell the story of a hotel and its owner, with each room presenting a unique comedy piece that illustrates part of the story. The rooms are curated by some of the world&#39;s finest and most innovative comedians, and also by me.</p>

<p>I am in charge of the Business Center, a room full of computers and other equipment all designed to mess with you in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.</p>

<p>I have given away more than enough - suffice to say this is one of the must-see events of the Fringe. These sorts of things don&#39;t come along often - how could they? Renovating a Hotel is an awful lot of hard work.</p>

<p>Come and check it out: 5th to the 31st of August (but not the 17th) at &quot;Assembly @ George Street - Meeting Place Theatre&quot;, at 4:15pm. It goes for about an hour. You will wish you could stay longer.</p>
