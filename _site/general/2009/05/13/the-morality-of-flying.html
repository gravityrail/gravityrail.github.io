<div class="post">
<p>Caveat: We&#39;re one bottle of wine into a two-bottle evening.</p>

<p>I was chatting to a really wonderful friend-of-a-friend tonight. She runs a really cool-sounding consultancy that does corporate psychology mixed with reducing a company&#39;s environmental footprint. Searching for the ultimate win-win of happy people, happy planet I guess.</p>

<p>I mentioned my upcoming trip to the US, and subsequent trip to the UK. Some of what I&#39;m doing is talking about uses of technology to advance environmental and social causes, particularly carbon neutrality (or my preferred initiative, carbon/consumption benefit). And she immediately shot back with: &quot;I take it you&#39;re flying there? Why not do it remotely via the Internet?&quot;.</p>

<p>I have no reasonable response to that. To be honest, I <em>like</em> travelling. I really, really do. Immersion in another culture, meeting new people, creating new opportunities and generally just breaking the old routine. It&#39;s fun, it&#39;s cool, I like it.</p>

<p>This whole conversation made me feel like a complete self-indulgent asshole. Which I admit, to a degree, I am. So what to do? How does Al Gore justify flying (if, indeed, he doesn&#39;t come by boat or just teleport using the US&#39;s poorly-hidden inventory of clearly alien technology).</p>

<p>To be frank: How does one reconcile taking a plane flight to educate people about reducing pollution, when flying is one inefficient-ass way of moving about?</p>

<p>Is it morally equivalent to shooting one innocent person in the head on the way to a conference on the reduction of gun violence? Hey, they were in the way! I needed to get to the conference!</p>

<p>Mood: <em>ashamed</em></p>

<p>(with apologies to Livejournal)</p>
