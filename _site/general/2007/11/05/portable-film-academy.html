<div class="post">
<p>Last weekend I was lucky enough to be part of the inaugural Portable Film Academy. Thanks to Andrew Apostola and all the crew, helpers, speakers and other attendees it was a great weekend and I really learned a lot.</p>

<p>The core task for the weekend was to create an original online series, and below you can watch Episode 1 of our series called &quot;Forever&quot;. This was produced by myself, Johnny Blank and Sebastian Goldspink.</p>

<p>Also a huge thanks to our star Oliver Clark, who was just brilliant as Karl. He nailed every scene in one or two takes, which was great because we were under a lot of time pressure.</p>
