<p>Sometimes it helps to look to the past in order to put the present in context. With that in mind, here&#39;s a song I wrote in 2000, just before the US and Australian elections.
<h2>War is Over</h2>
Words and Music by Dan Walmsley</p>

<p>It&#39;s the year 2000
End of the twentieth century
In which humans perfected
All kinds of hideous weaponry</p>

<p>The first and second world wars
Showed us the ways of evil men
But now we&#39;ve learned the lessons of history
We&#39;ll never have to learn them again</p>

<p><strong>Peace upon the Earth</strong></p>

<p>Many wars were caused
By leaders going off their tree
But Democracy will make
Our leaders act responsibly</p>

<p>Our voting rights ensure they&#39;ll do
Exactly what we say
And if we protest something loud enough
I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll back the fuck away</p>

<p><strong>Because war is over
Peace from now on
Technology will help us move away from fossil fuels
And the Middle Eastern tension will be gone</strong></p>

<p>War benefits just two groups
In modern societies
Weapons manufacturers
And construction companies</p>

<p>So preventing war is simple
All we have to do is say
People closely linked to those two groups
Cannot run the USA</p>

<p><strong>Peace upon the earth</strong></p>

<p>Now that war is over
We can turn our thoughts to peace
Use the SAS to find lost kids
And go on missions planting trees</p>

<p>By next year our great nation
Will have reconciled our violent past
And that unpopular John Howard
Will be voted out at last</p>

<p><strong>Because war is over,
Peace has come at last,
Kyoto will be signed, society we be refined,
And violence will be looked upon as crass</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yeah war is over,
Peace forever more,
We&#39;ve hurt so much and learned so much in the 20th century,
I can&#39;t wait to see what the 21st one has in store</strong></p>
