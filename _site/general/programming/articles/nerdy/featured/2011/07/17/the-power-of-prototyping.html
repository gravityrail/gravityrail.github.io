<p>This is the first in what will be a series of blog posts for the Mozilla-Knight Journalism Challenge. This week we heard from <a href="http://www.azarask.in/blog/" target="_blank">Aza Raskin</a>, former creative lead for Firefox and head of user experience for <a href="http://mozilla.com" target="_blank">Mozilla</a>, talking about the power of prototyping for understanding problems and building momentum behind your solution.</p>

<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/goldsounds/UnlockingVideo?authkey=Gv1sRgCP690om2p67vsAE&amp;pli=1#5615321524278144370"><img class="size-medium wp-image-522" title="mockup" src="http://www.danwalmsley.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/mockup-273x300.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="300" align="center" /></a></p>

<p>As a programmer I often build <a href="https://github.com/gravityrail">throw-away apps</a> in my spare time just to see how something works, explore a new API, or to discover new ways of solving old problems. However, in my professional life as a web developer, it&#39;s easy to see building prototypes as a luxury. I&#39;ve often had to fight for a budget that allows for scoping and prototyping, and even more often had to go without.</p>

<p>Raskin&#39;s presentation, &quot;<a href="http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/how-to-prototype-and-influence-people/">How to Prototype and Influence People</a>&quot;, explores the advantages of prototyping in ways that I hadn&#39;t previously recognised. These insights can be grouped into two main areas:</p>

<hr />

<p><em>1. Developing a better understanding of the problem</em></p>

<p>Trying several ways to solve a problem leads to a better solution, but can also lead to the recognition of a deeper problem on which the solution is dependent. Raskin used the tale of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_MacCready">Paul MacReady</a>&#39;s winning of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kremer_prize">Kremer Prize</a>&Acirc;&nbsp;for long-distance human-powered flight&Acirc;&nbsp;as an example of this; MacReady&#39;s key insight was that by dramatically reducing the time to repair and modify his aircraft, he could arrive at a winning design in a matter of months instead of decades. He was right. Failing fast through prototyping&Acirc;&nbsp;led to rapid learning, which led to rapid improvement.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>2. Building support for your idea or product</em></p>

<p>Many entrepreneurs toil for years on products that are technically interesting without ever testing the interface on a live end-user. To an end-user a product is not an idea, nor a technology. <strong>To your customers, the product <em>is </em>the interface.</strong>By encouraging end-users to experience some aspect of a product&#39;s interface you can observe their reaction to it and learn how to communicate the benefits more effectively. Putting the prototype in the hands of end-users keeps you focused on solving real-world problems.</p>

<p>As Aza put it:&Acirc;&nbsp;<strong>The value of an idea is zero unless it can be communicated</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Aza&#39;s approach to prototyping is fast and pragmatic. He encourages creating the first prototype in a day.&Acirc;&nbsp;You&#39;re should be creating a &quot;visual sketch&quot;, a space people can move through with their ideas. This allows them to see the solution for themselves, which is always more convincing than being told how great an idea is, or being dictated to by an over-wrought solution. Palm&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hawkins">Jeff Hawkins</a> first prototyped their hand-held devices using blocks of wood - as lo-fi as it gets.</p>

<p>Aza began and ended the presentation with a quote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead">Margaret Mead</a>:
<blockquote>Never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world. Indeed, it&#39;s the only thing that ever has.</blockquote>
If you&#39;re a small team looking to change the world, then <a href="http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/how-to-prototype-and-influence-people/">recognising the power</a> of rapid prototyping could give your idea a big boost.</p>
