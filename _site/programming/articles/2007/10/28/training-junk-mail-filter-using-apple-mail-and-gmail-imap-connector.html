<div class="post">
<p>Like most people, I get literally thousands of spam messages a month. I never see them, of course, because they&#39;re filtered out by Gmail&#39;s incredible spam filtering system.</p>

<p>This is all well and good if you&#39;ve got a Gmail account, but what if you want Google-quality filtering for your business or other mail accounts?</p>

<p>Well, thanks to Gmail IMAP support, we now have a <b>massive and incredibly accurate data set</b> for training Apple Mail&#39;s junk filter. Gmail IMAP lets you browse folders other than your inbox. So once you&#39;ve added it to your Apple Mail account list, simply browse to the Spam folder, select all, then mark those messages As Junk.</p>

<p>This simple act will train Mail&#39;s bayesian spam filtering system on everything in your GMail spam folder, no doubt instantly improving its performance somewhat. In my case, the spam folder usually has 3000-4000 messages in it, which is fairly hefty and it would certainly take a lot of clicking to get that kind of data by hand.</p>

<p>Thanks Google!</p>
