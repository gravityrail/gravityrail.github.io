<p class="meta">20 Jan 2008</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Was up until 3am last night banging my head against another frustrating go-nowhere issue deploying Wicket on Debian Etch&#39;s default Tomcat5.5.</p>

<p>Apparently the latest version (5.5.20-2etch1) has additional security <strike>headaches</strike> features which prevent wicket from functioning properly out-of-the-box:
<ul>
    <li>First of all, there&#39;s still an (as-yet-unsolved) mystery around why I couldn&#39;t get Wicket to start up as a filter. Just the mysterious &quot;ERROR: filterStart&quot; which makes me want to feed Tomcat to angry lions. Worked around it by using Wicket in Servlet mode instead.</li></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;li&gt;Tomcat&#39;s juli.jar can&#39;t access WEB-INF/classes/logging.properties. Fixed (in sledgehammer-like way) by adding &quot;permission java.security.AllPermission;&quot; to /etc/tomcat5.5/policy.d/03catalina.policy, in the Juli section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tomcat security prevents webapps from accessing all sorts of features and methods by default, including wicket.properties, methods inside shipped jars, etc. Not being a Tomcat expert, and trusting the innate security of the server and millions of lines of third party code (i.e. I&#39;m an idiot) I again just popped a java.security.AllPermission; in appropriate spots in /etc/tomcat5.5/policy.d/04webapps.policy. Let the flames commence!&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p></ul></p>

<p>If Tomcat was a little more helpful in its error messages, this would never have been so painful. Jetty has always run my Wicket apps without complaint (though I&#39;ve never tried the official Debian Jetty packages - maybe they&#39;re <strike>crippleware</strike> secure too?).</p>

<p>The only reason I use Tomcat at all is the remote management and deployment features, which are well-supported by Cargo. Now that these issues are out of the way (mostly) I can take another few steps towards my dream of a seamless, fire-and-forget, auto-deploying, smoke-tested, pluggable and modular web app deployment system.</p>

<p>Oh, and have I mentioned recently how much I LOVE IInitializer?</p>

<p>Bless you, Wicket. Bless you.</p>
