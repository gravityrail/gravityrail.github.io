<div class="post">
<p>So, I lost my iPhone a while ago and that was annoying.</p>

<p>Then my annoyance doubled when I realised that my Google contacts were no longer being synced to my OS X Address Book. It turns out that Apple will only let you synchonise Google contacts when you have an iPhone connected to the system.</p>

<p>This would have to be the most brain-damaged mis-feature I&#39;ve seen in years. It&#39;s not like my laptop has to access Google <strong>through</strong> the iPhone. It&#39;s just a completely arbitrary co-dependence of two otherwise utterly unrelated features of the computer.</p>

<p>Luckily there&#39;s a workaround for those who no longer have an iPhone but enjoyed the Google Contact syncing. It&#39;s a short script, so only really useful to those willing to get their hands dirty in the shell.</p>

<pre lang="bash">
#!/bin/sh
echo "Syncing Contacts with Google"
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/GoogleContactSync.framework/Versions/A/Resources/gconsync --sync com.google.ContactSync
echo "Sync Complete"
</pre>

<p>There - done! I suppose you could turn it into a launchd script if you&#39;re really keen, but I&#39;m happy to just run it by hand from time-to-time. Eat it, Apple!</p>
