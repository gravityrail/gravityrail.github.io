I'm really not obsessed with geek girls, really! I just had to post this: a girl who's <a href="http://www.datagridgirl.com/">whole web site</a>  is dedicated to datagrid controls. And guess what else? She <a href="http://www.datagridgirl.com/rent.aspx">rents herself out</a>! I hope her grids are a little more reliable than <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N14241046.htm">some</a>.<br />
