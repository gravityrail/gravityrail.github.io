  content: ! "looks pretty awesome, I couldn't find canberra in any searches though,
    and I couldn't get very good resolution on anything as far east as Richmond in
    Melbourne.\r\n\r\nI also couldn't get any roads appearing on Australia.\r\n\r\nI
    haven't played with it very much, so these things might be just behind that next
    button click, \r\n\r\ndoes it allow the community to make contributions to the
    maps?"

  content: ! "You know, all this time I thought Dr Doom was you.  Cause that makes
    sense.  And now, you have challenged me with this conversation with yourself,
    or else I need to become aware that Dr D00m is another party.\r\n\r\nOh wait,
    hold on, I don't really care that much.  I am commenting from boredom."

In a move seemingly designed to make me ruin the inside of my panties, Google has released the first cut of its <a href="http://desktop.google.com/download/earth/index.html">Earth product</a>, based on technology it acquired when it purchased Keyhole.

The product is, in a nutshell, a copy of the earth on your computer. In fact what it does it stream detailed data from Google's massive database so that you only see the parts of the earth that you're interested in at any particular time. It can also overlay data such as roads, populations, crime rates etc.

But don't take my word for it, check out <a href="http://www.webpronews.com/insiderreports/searchinsider/wpn-49-20050628IntroducingGoogleEarth.html">some</a> <a href="http://blogs.pcworld.com/techlog/archives/000748.html">reviews</a>.
