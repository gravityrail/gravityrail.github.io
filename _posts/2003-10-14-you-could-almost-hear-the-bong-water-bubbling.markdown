I was listening to a friend of mine DJ-ing on LaTrobe University's <a href="http://www.subfm.org/">SubFM</a>, and while doing a back-announce, she uttered these words:
<blockquote>[surprised] Well, it seems like we've got a listening-type-thing happening, so hi to Shane and Dan.</blockquote>

Yeah, I hear those listening-type-things are likely occur when you broadcast yourself to a potential audience of <i>several million people</i>.
