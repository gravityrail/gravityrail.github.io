Hey, everybodies! <a href="http://thebreakfastshow.net.au/index.php">The Breakfast Show</a> is back for 2007, broadcasting on Melbourne's Community TV powerhouse, <a href="http://www.channel31.org.au">Channel 31</a>.

I'm going to be appearing every second Wednesday at 7:40am to present my own segment, tentatively titled "Beam Down to Planet Nerd". The topics are usually computer-related but can range across the full spectrum of nerdiness, from slot cars to box kites.

An <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2007/05/06/1178390129649.html?page=fullpage">article appeared in The Age this morning</a> which provides a well-rounded look at the evolution of the show, and the benefits and challenges of community media.

Tune in! <strong>IF YOU CAN</strong>.
