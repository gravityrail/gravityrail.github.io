Hey, everybodies! <a href="http:&#47;&#47;thebreakfastshow.net.au&#47;index.php">The Breakfast Show<&#47;a> is back for 2007, broadcasting on Melbourne's Community TV powerhouse, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.channel31.org.au">Channel 31<&#47;a>. 

I'm going to be appearing every second Wednesday at 7:40am to present my own segment, tentatively titled "Beam Down to Planet Nerd". The topics are usually computer-related but can range across the full spectrum of nerdiness, from slot cars to box kites.

An <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.theage.com.au&#47;articles&#47;2007&#47;05&#47;06&#47;1178390129649.html?page=fullpage">article appeared in The Age this morning<&#47;a> which provides a well-rounded look at the evolution of the show, and the benefits and challenges of community media. 

Tune in! <strong>IF YOU CAN<&#47;strong>.
