Many thanks to <a href="http://www.asymptomatic.net">Owen</a> for helping me out with his <a href="http://www.asymptomatic.net/_wiki/GeoPlugin">Geo</a> plugin for Wordpress. I'm always pleasantly surprised when I deal with the OSS and blogging communities - everyone is really friendly and goes out of their way to help people they don't even know.

As you can see, the are a few more smatterings of geo links around the site. I'm slowly going to whittle them down to the most useful/elegant. I'm pretty excited about where all this stuff is going...
