  content: Is that better?
---
This is just great.  A while ago I had a <a href="http://">protracted tangle</a> with some Nigerian-style spammers (they were from the Ivory Coast, but whatever). Now this guy has produced a monologue of a Nigerian scam email, and it's <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/request/index_better.html">really well done</a>.

I am the lazy blogger everyone ignores.
