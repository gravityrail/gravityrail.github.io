  content: ! "The big looser in all of this is indipendant music.  \r\nIf RIAA forces
    users into smaller sharing communities then although they're not really stopping
    the availability of their own top50 chart musics, they are making it a lot harder
    to get their compeditors offerings.\r\n\r\nYour points on adding taste heuristics
    to trust heuristics is good, but most of these p2p networks operate on searches
    rather than browsing so you're really only going to get what you search for, so
    the only time taste becomes important is in guessing how likely that user is to
    have what you want...  I don't know where I'm going with that... bah, back to
    the salt mines"

  content: ! "It's true that peer-to-peer, on whatever scale it ends up clustering,
    vastly favours the top 10% of the most popular files. \r\n\r\nOne thing that P2P
    networks <em>should</em> be remarkably good at that they aren't yet doing
    is determining the relationships between files depending on how often a particular
    node requests, say, songs by particular artists, and which files exist on that
    node. If you assume that the node belongs to an individual, then you can approximate
    their tastes by enumerating the list of available files and doing Amazon-style
    statistical analysis. \r\n\r\nThis gives you the whole \"people who liked X also
    liked Y\" thing. Which people clearly really dig, because it's one of the cornerstones
    of Amazon.com's business model.\r\n\r\nP2P networks currently operate on searches,
    but as a happy Acquisition user I can wholeheartedly say that I now also operate
    50% of the time on browsing. \r\n\r\nIf I find a node has a track by a band that
    I like, I can click a button and browse <em>every</em> file hosted on that
    node. More often than not, it turns out that they have a whole heap of stuff I
    like, and also a whole heap of stuff I'd never heard of that I discover that I
    like.\r\n\r\nThis is directly analogous to the trust-taste directed graph. The
    P2P client tracks which nodes supplied me with stuff that I like, and assumes
    that there'll be more stuff that I like in the same place, particularly where
    said stuff has a strong statistical correlation vis-a-vis location across the
    whole network."

    a fatal flaw, especially in systems like Outfoxed which just <i>presents</i>

Continuing my recent theme of social networks, trust, searching and filesharing I present an <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/file-sharing_social.html">article by Clay Shirky</a>.

He describes the technological and social effects of the RIAA's strategies against file-sharing: by attacking some of the few nodes that make a large number of files accessible for most of the time, they have sufficiently weakened the system that users are angry, both at Kazaa (for example) and the RIAA.

Shirky goes on to describe a new kind of system, one that is slowly evolving today, based on "trust networks". Users invite each other to join networks of trust, smaller and even less centralised than the current generation of P2P networks (Gnutella, Kazaa, eDonkey etc). Shirky claims that the efficiency of these networks in finding desired content is higher than one might expect for a random distribution of files, because users who trust each other are likely to have similar tastes.

This brings me to a criticism that has been levelled at <a href="http://getoutfoxed.com">Outfoxed</a>, and which I think is appropriate here: Trust is not absolute or all-encompassing. If my friend George is a Professor of Theoretical Mathematics at Princeton, then of course I'll trust his opinion on anything mathematical - however, he may also be a recalcitrant sexist pig, so I wouldn't trust his opinion on women.

Likewise, I may trust my friends not to rat on me to the RIAA when we share files, but I may also think their taste in music is crap (this is, in fact, true).

So when we talk about the trust vectors that we hook into the cloud, they need to have more dimensions than just "who?" and "how much?". They also need "with regards to what?". In order to operate efficiently our file-sharing trust networks need to be built on an heuristic which combines both "secrecy" (traditional trust)  and "semantics" - to let us walk the traditional trust graph to content we actually want.
