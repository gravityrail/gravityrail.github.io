Still sucks.

Highlight of the day: Coughing up my lungs in the shower for half an hour this morning.

Quote of the day: "Mmm... tastes like brown!" (Mia claims this is the most awful thing I've ever said, but I beg to differ - she hasn't heard everything I've ever said)

Swine flu definitely sucks.

More news as it happens.
