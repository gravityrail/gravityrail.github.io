I saw this user review at <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/">IMDB.com</a> and had to share. How many of you have seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? And how many would compare it to Total Recall or Desperately Seeking Susan?

<strong>Summary:</strong> "Nice" movie that proves the ride is what matters
<blockquote>
    Greetings again from the darkness. Writer Charlie Kaufman has a frightening brain and loves to share it. While not at the level of "Being John Malkovich" or "Adaptation", this Kaufman script takes the film-goer on a ride to prove that's what it's all about. The only thing that life in general and relationships specifically, offer are the memories and experiences. Results matter little. Jim Carrey bashers will surely crucify his dramatic turn, but most will see the depth he brings to the role. He can act ... it is just difficult for many to get past the Carrey icon. Kirsten Dunst again proves she is so much more than a pretty face. She leaps off the screen with pain and joy and eagerness. Mark Ruffalo and Tom Wilkinson provide steady supporting roles, but the biggest disappointment is Kate Winslet. Think knock-off of Madonna in "Desperately Seeking Susan". She does not have the edge necessary to pull off this role. Her scenes come up empty when it is necessary for her to step up. Many will liken the film to "Total Recall", but thanks to the writing, it will take you much deeper in your feelings than Arnold ever has! So enjoy the story (even if it a bit far-fetched) and the wonderful visuals and be thankful there are filmmakers willing to take risks.</blockquote>
