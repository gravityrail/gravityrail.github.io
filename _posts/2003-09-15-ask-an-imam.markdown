  content: ! "Assalamu-Alaikum,\r\n\r\nMy name is Mohamed. About 8 weeks ago I lost
    my father. I have a three year old son who is not fully aware of death. He refers
    to my father as dada. Whenever he asked about his dada, we w reply and say that
    he is gone to Allah &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Paaks House. \r\n\r\nLast week , I asked
    him where he was going for the day and he replied,&acirc;&euro;\x9D to my dada&acirc;&euro;\x9D.
    This brought some fear into me. Last night he told me that dada is coming for
    him. \r\n\r\nI am terrified. Is something going to happen to my son. Am I being
    peronoid. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease assist me. I am in total depression.\r\n\r\n\r\nSalaams"

Anything you ever wanted to know about the Islamic faith, you can ask <a href="http://www.islam.tc/ask-imam/index.php">here</a>. e.g.

<blockquote>1)My friend was asking if it is permissible to let his wife dominate him.also,is use of sex toys like dildo on private parts of wife and husband permissible in islam? </blockquote>

Ask this of a catholic priest, and he'd run to the bathroom. Also, how paranoid do you have to be to use the "My friend..." line in an anonymous chat room?
