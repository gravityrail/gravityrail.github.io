This has been a crazy-ass week. I almost feel like a working comic (and, consequently, a bit less like a working programmer, to the frustration of my boss) - Wednesday was my show, <a href="http://pinkhorseofwhimsy.com">The Pink Horse of Whimsy</a>. Thursday, <a href="http://www.glitch.com.au/cut_and_paste.html">Cut & Paste</a> (improv), and tonight... more improv! Instant Order: Trial By Jury with <a href="http://www.thecrew.com.au">The Crew</a>.

It's been really great, but it's also quite tiring and probably unsustainable. Still, a good warm-up for the Adelaide Fringe.

On a completely unrelated note, the guy in the next office has been coughing all morning. But it's not really a cough, but a sort of throat-clearing, mucus-raising growl, the sort that makes your eyes water just hearing it. The worst thing is that I realised: he does it all the time. It's just that now it's made its way into my conscious mind, where it will annoy and distract me forever.

I have to get out of this shitty-ass job.
