I saw this poster in the window of a local hairdresser (-37"47'21, 144"58'23), and had <strong>no</strong> idea what it is.

So I asked my friend Barbara, and got the following response:

Hey Chester,

My friend Dan took this photo somewhere in Melbourne and wants to know
what it is. I got as far as "Digital Revolution" and then I think "Now
totally possible!" before the characters got too small for my
untrained eyes to laboriously decode. Can you help us out?

You pretty much got the top part.  The things in the boxes are as
follows (please bear in mind this is a slightly intoxicated
translation):

1. "Volume saving voluminous perm."
2. Also short hair "setting" perm
3. Acid perm without hair damage
4. "Seramide / theramide (an English loan word I can't distiguish
since I have no knowledge of hair dressing or chemistry and doesn't
appear in my dictionary)" acid coating perm
5. Operation time reduced by 1/2 (this one is kind of funny because
the word '&Acirc;&frac12;&Atilde;&fnof;&Acirc;&frac14;&Atilde;&ordm;' usually refers to surgery.  I was unaware that it
could be used in referece to hair styling as well).

I can't really make out the words in the red box at the bottom (aside
from the word "setting" written out in Korean and the big "OK" at the
end).  Next time I get my hair cut I'll ask the hairstylist about
"seramide" as opposed to "theramide" and attempt to figure that
nonsense out.
