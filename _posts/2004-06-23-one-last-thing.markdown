about Meegos.

Choice quote from one of the <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/6/4/meegos-are-cool">astroturfer's posts</a>:

<blockquote>funny how people with no job but to knock everyone else think that they have authority in many topics that are internet related</blockquote>

Whoops! I'm a web developer and systems administrator, and have been involved with the Internet in one way or another for over ten years.

Next time, attack someone on <a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com/">geocities</a>.
