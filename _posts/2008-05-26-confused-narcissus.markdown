Ok, so a while ago I set up a <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alert</a> to inform me of happenings related to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22dan+walmsley%22">myself</a>, and periodically it tells me someone on the web called "Dan Walmsley" (typically an <a href="www.a1clubireland.com/?cat=16">Irish F1 Engineer</a>, but occasionally me) has been written about.

Today, however, the results were <a href="http://raviodetta.wordpress.com/2008/05/24/brizimprovfest-interviews-impro-musos/">far more disturbing</a>.

<blockquote>Dan twinned the Steward way in back circuitously 2002 for example a musician in re the non-philharmonic restlessness. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Ace did exclamation in order to the administration &acirc;&euro;&tilde;oh, ourselves sense, Themselves do up have it gently too&acirc;&euro;&trade;,&acirc;&euro; me recalled as to his untimely days. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Nonetheless top brass didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t factually accredit oneself.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote>

First of all, I think I've been misquoted.

Second of all, <i>who does this article benefit</i>?

Thirdly, the post categories are: "african american, audism, feel good tips, republicans, yasin". <i>Why</i>?

Fourthly, it's clearly a translation of <a href="http://www.sarahjansen.com/2007/06/brizimprovfest_interviews_impro_musos.html">this article</a>. <i>But a translation into what</i>? Half-English gibberish?

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to hard evidence that synonym-generation does not lead to 100% readability during summary generation. This reminds me of my lost year at <a href="http://www.nicta.com.au">NICTA</a>.
