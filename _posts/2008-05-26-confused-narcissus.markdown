Ok, so a while ago I set up a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;alerts">Google Alert<&#47;a> to inform me of happenings related to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;search?q=%22dan+walmsley%22">myself<&#47;a>, and periodically it tells me someone on the web called "Dan Walmsley" (typically an <a href="www.a1clubireland.com&#47;?cat=16">Irish F1 Engineer<&#47;a>, but occasionally me) has been written about.

Today, however, the results were <a href="http:&#47;&#47;raviodetta.wordpress.com&#47;2008&#47;05&#47;24&#47;brizimprovfest-interviews-impro-musos&#47;">far more disturbing<&#47;a>.

<blockquote>Dan twinned the Steward way in back circuitously 2002 for example a musician in re the non-philharmonic restlessness. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Ace did exclamation in order to the administration &acirc;&euro;&tilde;oh, ourselves sense, Themselves do up have it gently too&acirc;&euro;&trade;,&acirc;&euro; me recalled as to his untimely days. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Nonetheless top brass didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t factually accredit oneself.&acirc;&euro;<&#47;blockquote>

First of all, I think I've been misquoted. 

Second of all, <i>who does this article benefit<&#47;i>?

Thirdly, the post categories are: "african american, audism, feel good tips, republicans, yasin". <i>Why<&#47;i>?

Fourthly, it's clearly a translation of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sarahjansen.com&#47;2007&#47;06&#47;brizimprovfest_interviews_impro_musos.html">this article<&#47;a>. <i>But a translation into what<&#47;i>? Half-English gibberish?

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to hard evidence that synonym-generation does not lead to 100% readability during summary generation. This reminds me of my lost year at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nicta.com.au">NICTA<&#47;a>.
