<a href="http://www.cdbaby.net/">CD Baby</a> is an awesome site dedicated to <strike>profiting from unfortunate stoners</strike> helping independant artists distribute their music. They have a surprisingly simple but effective business model:
<ul>
<li>Pay them $40 (US) to encode your CD (artists keep all copyrights, rights to non-digital distribution, and can leave at any time with 30 days notice)</li>
<li>They distribute it to Rhapsody, iTunes, and other digital distribution outlets</li>
<li>For every dollar made, 9c goes to CDBaby, 91c goes to the artist</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ul><br />
I'm sure there are caveats and catches, but it still sounds a lot better than the traditional model:
<ul>
<li>Get signed by music label</li>
<li>They distribute CD, all expenses incurred are culled from any royalties you make</li>
<li>Artists don't actually own their own music, copyrights, or distribution rights - these go to the label</li>
<li>Artists get a couple of cents in the dollar, but are left with crippling debts</li>
<li>Label goons tie up artists' grandmothers and slowly break their fingers to blackmail artists back into the studio</li>
<li>Artists die alcoholic and alone</li>
</ul>
<br />
My plan for goldsounds.com was always to turn it into a music site, so don't be surprised if you see a CD-baby-ish business model appear. I like it a lot.
