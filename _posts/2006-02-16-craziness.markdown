Hello again, world - GoldSounds is back. Again. In case you're wondering what's been keeping me busy:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pinkhorseofwhimsy.com">The Pink Horse of Whimsy</a> - a live variety show in Melbourne, Australia that has been running for the last 5 weeks. The final week is next week, just before I head to Adelaide for the Fringe.</li>
<li><a href="http://georgielove.com">GeorgieLove.com</a> - my first e-commerce site! The idea came from Sally, the inspiration from her dog George.</li>
<li><a href="http://thesmallnews.com">The Small News</a> - nothing to see here yet, but coming soon is The Small News Podcast, an audio and video blog focusing on current events</li>
</ul>

So I haven't been posting on GoldSounds much, but dammit - I WANT TO. My people need me. I've seen the logs. For some reason, my blog is very popular in Venezuela. Let's take up the fight!

Love,
Dan
