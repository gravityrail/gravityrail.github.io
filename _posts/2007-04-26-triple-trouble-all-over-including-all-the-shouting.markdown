Ladies and gentlemen...
<h2>Triple Trouble is now OVER for 2007<&#47;h2>
(cue streamers)
<b>Thank you<&#47;b> to everyone who took part, particularly those behind-the-scenes people who so rarely get credited:
<ul>
<li>Mia Anstee, promotion and front-of-house<&#47;li>
<li>Paul Verhoeven, promotion and front-of-house<&#47;li>
<li>Renata Muss, promotion (who also performed)<&#47;li> 
<li>The Laundry, for giving me a room<&#47;li>
<li>And all my performers, for forgiving me the kinks and flaws that come with one's debut show, and making the show funny night after night. Thank you!<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>
That's all for now folks - stay tuned.
