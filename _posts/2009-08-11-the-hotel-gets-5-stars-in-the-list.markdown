I'm celebrating today as one of my shows, "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.danwalmsley.com&#47;2009&#47;07&#47;04&#47;the-hotel&#47;">The Hotel<&#47;a>", got <a href="http:&#47;&#47;edinburghfestival.list.co.uk&#47;article&#47;19664-the-hotel&#47;">5 stars in The List<&#47;a>.

Still waiting for The Scotsman. Fingers crossed...

In the meantime Edinburgh Fringe rolls on, taking my energy, liver and emotional stability with it. It's a total rollercoaster, but of course I wouldn't have it any other way.

Good thing it's only a month.
