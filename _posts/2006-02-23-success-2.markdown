Last night was the final show for Season 1 of <a href="http://pinkhorseofwhimsy.com">The Pink Horse of Whimsy</a>. It's been tiring and joyful and stressful and encouraging and intense, and totally and utterly rewarding. And now I am <em>really</em> looking forward to a weekend away with my beloved, to totally forget about the outside world and just do almost nothing.

A massive thank-you to everyone who was involved, whether performing, rigging, moving chairs, collecting money or turning the lights on and off. Shows like this require a lot of help to get off the ground, and I've been really surprised by how many people freely gave their time for what was really a very silly concept.
