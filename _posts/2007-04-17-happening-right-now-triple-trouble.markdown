Hi there,

Well, here we are in the thick of Comedy Fest, and I think it's time I drew your attention to the phattest, hottest, maddest show there is - Triple Trouble. Stand-up, music and impro mashed together into one delectable soup of comedy goodness.

Head on over to the <a href="http://danwalmsley.com/triple-trouble">Triple Trouble page</a> to find out more. It's a different line-up every night, so you're guaranteed to be entertained no matter how many times you come down.

Super!

Dan
