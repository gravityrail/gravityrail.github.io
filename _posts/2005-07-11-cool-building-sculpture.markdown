    apartments, having never lived in one I feel I'm well positioned to comment on
    their inferiority to proper houses with yards and space."

  content: Both have their pros and cons. My apartment in the CBD was across the road
    from the Exhibition/Carlton gardens one of the most beautiful gardens in Melbourne,
    and one block from the Fitzroy/Treasury gardens. The apartment that I moved
    into in South Yarra was one block from the Botanic Gardens and across the road
    from Fawkner Park. I didn't need a back yard :-)

  content: ! "I never saw that apartment.  But I have very happy memories at the South
    Yarra one.  Sure, it was a wanky suburb, your neighbours had weird fights at 3am,
    and your house was always damp and weird smelling, but lying in your bed watching
    the trees during storms was wonderful.  Chasing Georgie around the park.  Having
    inappropriate dares on park benches.  Nice, cheap, long and lazy breakfasts.  Reading
    the newspaper in the sun in the grass.  Wine on the balcony, etc.  \r\n\r\nThe
    place in Carlton is better for you though, but you and I have different housing/social
    needs. :-D\r\n\r\nLife tends to force you to shed one circumstance for the opportunity
    of a bigger one.  Life is a series of trade offs.  Yes, this is a metaphor.  Hello
    Metaphor.  MAN!  That would be such an awesome website name.  www.hellometaphor.com.

I used to live in this group of buildings. It cost AUD$120 a week, and there was a free tennis court, swimming pool, gymnasium and it was right in the middle of everything. I could walk almost everywhere I needed to go. <br />
<br />
Then, I clearly went completely insane and moved out of this amazing apartment to live by myself in South Yarra, the Katie Holmes of Melbourne: cute but nothing interesting going on upstairs.
