Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.newyorker.com&#47;humor&#47;2008&#47;09&#47;22&#47;080922sh_shouts_saunders?currentPage=all">Super Satire<&#47;a>!
<blockquote>So, when Barack Obama says he will put some lipstick on my pig, I am, like, Are you calling me a pig? If so, thanks! Pigs are the most non-&Atilde;&permil;lite of all barnyard animals. And also, if you put lipstick on my pig, do you know what the difference will be between that pig and a pit bull? I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll tell you: a pit bull can easily kill a pig. And, as the pig dies, guess what the Hockey Mom is doing? Going to her car, putting on more lipstick, so that, upon returning, finding that pig dead, she once again looks identical to that pit bull, which, staying on mission, the two of them step over the dead pig, looking exactly like twins, except the pit bull is scratching his lower ass with one frantic leg, whereas the Hockey Mom is carrying an extra hockey stick in case Todd breaks his again. But both are going, like, Ha ha, where&acirc;&euro;&trade;s that dumb pig now? Dead, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s who, and also: not a smidge of lipstick.

A lose-lose for the pig.<&#47;blockquote>
