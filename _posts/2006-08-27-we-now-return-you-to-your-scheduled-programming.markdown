Hi there, thanks for visiting. I've begun to return this site to normal, after the trans-normal experience of Mark Watson's Seemingly-Impossible 36-Hour Circuit of the World. This will be the jumping-off point on the web for my various projects in programming, comedy and music. So welcome! I hope you find something here that you like.

Dan
