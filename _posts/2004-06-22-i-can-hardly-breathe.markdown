I'm laughing so hard.

Okay, so a quick google search tells me that my blogging software <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> records the IP address of every comment.  So I search the database and lo, all the "<a href="http://203.31.219.111/archives/2004/6/4/meegos-are-cool/">meego</a>" comments (i.e. by user meego) are from the same IP. No big deal. So I search for the IP. And I find another comment from the same IP:

<blockquote>Wow Meego ur like heaps smart! I hope I can be as cool as you one day!

PS Fat chicks rock! </blockquote>

WTF?? I thought that was a sarcastic dig at meegos, but it was <strong>actually meego praising himself</strong>.

So I dig a little deeper. The IP address of the poster is in Milton, NSW - according to <a href="http://www.xpenguin.com/plot.php?address=220.244.26.150#map">xpenguin.com</a>. This is because he uses <a href="http://www.tpgi.com.au/">TPGI</a> broadband to access the 'net. That's where they're based, or near enough.

Alright, we know where the poster came from. Now I wonder who owns meegos.com? A little check of <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/en_US/whois/results.jhtml;jsessionid=XC1RFU53NCUUICWLEAKSFEQ?_requestid=313147">networksolutions' whois service</a> tells us it's one Dave Heysen, on behalf of the 3hgroup.com. So I find out the IP address of 3hgroup.com, and guess where they're based... yep! <a href="http://www.xpenguin.com/plot.php?address=210.87.32.119#map">Milton, NSW</a>.

Amazing how supportive the locals can be, eh Dave?*

Dave Heysen turns up all over the 'net - a while ago he was the director of Soulmates Technology / match.com international (Sydney).  He created matchmaking software for the TVMates Optus interactive broadband dating service, which according to the <a href="http://www3.optus.com.au/newsroom/1,1450,316,00.html">press release</a> saw "high number of visits and transactions from trialists" and then sank into a mire of nothingness.

Now he's at <a href="http://www.3hgroup.com/appage.htm">3hgroup</a>, presumably because he is "heaps smart", and according to their site has strengths from a "financial and personnel management perspective". Does managing your personnel include <a href="http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/a/astroturfing.html">astroturfing</a>, Dave?

Anyway, I've had enough fun for now. Let the issue rest, 3hgroup. All you're creating is an indelible log of your fruitless and cynical attempts to market <a href="http://ninemsn.meegos.com">loathsome pap</a> on a consumer base that's already way ahead of you **.

3h == har har har? ***

* for the record, I'm aware of just how unreliable geographic IP locators can be, but in this case can you really say "well, that's just a coincidence!"? I'd say that they're a fairly strong indicator that the meegos astroturfer and 3hgroup belong to the same ISP, which in turn hints at them being the same person. Of course, this is pure speculation - but isn't it <em>fun</em>? :-)
