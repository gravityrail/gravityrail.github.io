I laughed inappropriately loudly for the workplace when I found <a href="http://thememoryhole.org/feds/hud/rezedents_rights.htm">this document</a> at <a href="http://thememoryhole.org">The Memory Hole</a>.

Essentially, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) commissioned a pamphlet explaining people's rights, and one translation was requested specifically for the Creole-speaking Haitians living in HUD-provided housing in Miami. However, instead of translating into French-Creole, the sub-contractors (Thorner Press of Buffalo, N.Y.) created an English-Creole version. English-Creole is a dialect commonly spoken in Jamaica.

The Haitian government, when viewing the result, asked if it was some kind of racist joke.

So recline in your knitted beanie, roll a Camberwell Carrot, and enjoy the words of Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo Fella (head of HUD).
<blockquote>We ave a pawtnaship wid everi rezedent of HUD-assisted owzing  developments: Owzing protekss di rights ahf di tenants, ahn tenants gawd dem own right tru rispansible bi'ahviah. Owah goal is fi guh beyan dat pawtnaship ahn create a sense ahf community by encouraging di rezedents fi bekum more aktive ahn invalve demselves inna di decishans dat ahfek di development ahf deir own owzing developments.
