  content: ! "Honestly?  While it'll be cool and there's definately some cases where
    it will come in handy, I think such application won't have nearly so much impact
    as you'd imagine.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we've already got a pretty good in built data
    management system.  Important things aren't often forgotten, and unimportant things
    are.  The benefit of this is that you don't waste as much time on things that
    aren't important.  \r\n\r\nIf people can search everything they've ever experienced,
    then they will need to discipline themselves to NOT spend more time searching
    than they would spend on regular recall.\r\n\r\nThere's obviously the whole, forget
    painfull things and let the past go issues, but that's not really an argument
    as I'd imagine people could still delete files if they wanted to.\r\n\r\nThe implications
    for the legal system are interesting,  I can't see any way for personal records
    to be any more admissable as evidence than a human witness, but would it be any
    less?\r\n\r\nWe'd definately have trouble with stupid jurors not distinguishing
    between reliable sources and unreliable sources as they are likely to all look
    the same.  \r\nOn the other hand I'm of the opinion that there isn't really any
    such thing as a reliable source and there never really was, so perhaps it's better
    this way.\r\n\r\nI guess having such a system is a benefit, but whether the benifit
    is significant or not really depends on the speed of the search and the discipline
    of the user.  There's potentially for it to be a handicap for people who aren't
    able to utilise their system properly, but who really cares about the luddites
    anyway :P"

I just had one of those "oh, shit!" moments, when the future opens up before you like the mouth of a whale, and all you can do is wait helplessly for your tiny raft to be sucked into its distended bowels.

I use <a href="https://gmail.google.com">gmail</a> for basically every written communication I produce. Work, friends, relatives, strangers - everything. The benefit is that if I need to remember anything I ever wrote to someone else, or they wrote to me, I know I can just type a query into a seach box and <em>bam</em>, it's right there in front of me. I also load my gmail onto my Powerbook via the <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20041110192454841">POP3 interface</a>, so it's instantly searchable offline using <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/">Spotlight</a>. The usefulness of this system is such that I already can't imagine life without it.

Today, a friend mentioned an old spoken conversation we'd had, and I couldn't quite remember how it had gone, and I suddenly found myself wishing I could search my spoken conversations as easily as I could search gmail.

And then I realised what's going to happen. As mobile device storage goes up, there will be absolutely no technical impediment to just constantly collecting data about the world around us - images, video, audio. You will be able to search your entire life experience. Your own personal Google engine, constantly indexing and categorising the stream of data that your life produces without you even needing to be aware of it.

The potential utility of such a system is staggering, and so are the privacy and security implications should someone gain access to your personal databank. Nevertheless, it will soon be <em>possible</em> to store and index your life experience, and you can absolutely guarantee that some people are going to do it.

So here's one that I'm going to throw open to the audience (if I actually have one) - what do you think are the implications of being able to collect and search every life experience you have?
