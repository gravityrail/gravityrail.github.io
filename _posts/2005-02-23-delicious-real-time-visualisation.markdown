For those that don't know (uhh, that would be <em>most</em> people), <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> is a social bookmarking system for storing your personal bookmarks according to a set of tags. It's quite easy to use, and a lot of people are using it. It also aggregates everyone's tags into a cohesive, searchable database. By the very nature of the way people use it, it tends to be a great way to track where the action is on the web for particular topics.

Anyhoo, someone at hubmeg.org has written the <a href="http://www.hubmed.org/touchgraphs/deltags.php?start=blogs">most awesome visualisation tool</a> for del.icio.us which links together sets of related tags into a kind of stretchy web thing that just has to be seen to be believed.
