  content: ! "Holy cow do they ever exploit family relations.\r\n\r\nMy sister's recently
    become involved with these clowns, and this last May had my mother set up a Mother's
    Day party for friends and relations to bring their mothers.  Yes, this turned
    out to be an excuse for my sister to set up an ACN sales meeting.  Disgusting.\r\n\r\nIt's
    bad enough that this outfit is so shady, but that they're peddling such impractical
    science fiction technology makes it even worse.\r\n\r\nYou know, it's really difficult
    to find arguments, whether pro or con, regarding video phones online.  I was surprised
    to find that I'm not the only one that's got a beef with these guys.\r\n\r\nWould
    you have any other information regarding these folks?  I'm trying to talk my parents
    from joining up with her in this mess.\r\n\r\nSorry for ranting on your site,
    and thank you for your time."

  content: ! "WHAT IS THE SECRET THAT THE &acirc;&euro;&oelig;ANTI-GOD CULT&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    CALLED &acirc;&euro;&oelig;SCIENTOLGY&acirc;&euro;\x9D FEARS THE MOST FROM BEING
    EXPOSED?\r\n\r\nThe secret most un-exposed about Scientology is that is it an
    &acirc;&euro;&oelig;applied physiological philosophy&acirc;&euro;\x9D rather than
    an &acirc;&euro;&oelig;applied religious philosophy&acirc;&euro;\x9D. All Scientology
    courses, all auditing processes, and all the management and professional courses
    are based on physiological phenomenas, psychophysiology, emotions, human behavior
    patterns etc., that are our birth right and used in Scientology as their own discoveries.
    Even their PTS-SP data is based upon how a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Symptom&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    re-stimulation is brought out by physiological reactions of the mind affecting
    the body when under stress. They blame innocent human beings called by them &acirc;&euro;&oelig;suppressive
    persons&acirc;&euro;\x9D for bringing out a symptom that was there to warn you
    of hidden real illnesses caused by non-suppressive sources such as parasites,
    chemicals, poisons, toxins, viruses and bacteria. The data on PTS-SP is twisted
    by them to blame innocent people in order to keep them in line.\r\n\r\nThe only
    way to fight them is to expose to the world--how Scientology has used physiological
    phenomenas as the basis for a false religion. How it has harmed families by claiming
    that innocent mothers and fathers are SPs -- when they lied about symptom re-stimulations
    to the world.\r\n\r\nNo where in Scientology will you find courses on any bible,
    there is no study or belief in heaven, hell, saints, angels, the devil, or even
    God himself. They do not study religion or even believe in religions. They do
    not share common values with any other religion. Their goal is to eliminate all
    other religions.\r\n\r\nThe E-meter reads your physiological reactions, the Ronbots
    never calls it that&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;they call it the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;CHARGE&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    or the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;MASS&acirc;&euro;\x9D or &acirc;&euro;&oelig;ENGRAMS&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    OR &acirc;&euro;&oelig;MENTAL IMAGE PICTURES&acirc;&euro;\x9D that you have in
    your brain&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all meant to distract you from the truth.\r\n\r\nKnow
    this fact --- There is a law of Nature or law of God called &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Physiological
    Reactions&acirc;&euro;\x9D that is the true secret behind Scientology&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    Dianectic study technology.\r\n\r\nAUDITING ERASES AND LESSONS YOUR PHYSIOLOGICAL
    REACTIONS!!! Once they are gone &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; your symptoms can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    be re-stimulated by stress or arguments. This is how the scam works. Now when
    you argue with your mother and don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t get sick &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;
    you think she was the cause of all your illnesses.\r\n\r\nIf you were audited
    a hundred times (repeated) for a word that you were ordered to never clear or
    understand, and then made to read a page that contained that word&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it
    would never again read on the Emeter or cause a physiological reaction.\r\n\r\nLRH
    discovered that when you passed a misunderstood word&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you manifested
    many reactions of various types: Yawning, sleepiness, not there feeling, dizziness,
    blurry eyes, nervousness and dozens more.\r\n\r\nBeing the liar that he was, he
    claimed that physiological reactions which he now calls &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Dianetics&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    was &acirc;&euro;&oelig;&acirc;&euro;&tilde;his&acirc;&euro;\x9D invention and
    not a law of God; he hid the fact that it is our human inheritance since time
    began.\r\n\r\nGranted that his power of obnosis was the best in the world, his
    crime against humanity was to make a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;religion&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    based upon the falsehood, that it was his invention or creation and not a law
    of God belonging to all Humanity as their lawful right.\r\n\r\nAll living beings
    have physiological (The functions and activities of life or of living matter such
    as the organic processes of organs, tissues, or cells) phenomenas (observable
    reactions known through the senses rather than by thought or intuition), or physical
    manifestations (made evident by showing or displaying) or physical reactions,
    that we see or feel as symptoms, and they are external and&#47;or internal or
    visible signs or warnings given to us, by our creator to help us survive, help
    us increase our potential, our knowledge and our health.\r\nAll life on Earth
    has these cause and effect reactions called physiological phenomenas. All living
    beings whether they are plant, insect, retile or animal or human could not live
    without these reactions. They influence the body&acirc;&euro;&trade;s and the
    mind&acirc;&euro;&trade;s reactions to any form of stimuli, and have an influence
    on every cell of the body and mind. \r\n [Noun. Physiological reaction &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;
    Is an automatic instinctive unlearned reaction to a stimulus.]\r\n[Examples of
    physiological reactions:  inborn reflex, innate reflex, instinctive reflex, reflex
    response, unconditioned reflex, accommodation reflex, Babinski reflex, belching,
    headache, migraines, swelling, sweating, erections, blinking, blushing, burping,
    defecation reflex, disgorgement, involuntary eye blinking, farting, skin flush,
    gag reflex, goose bump, goose pimple, gooseflesh, involuntary gulping, involuntary
    hiccup, knee-jerk reflex, light reflex, puking, papillary reflex, rectal reflex,
    regurgitation, shaking, shiver, shock, sneezing, startle, stretch reflex, suckling
    reflex, trembling, upset stomach, vomiting, involuntary winking, yawn, yawning
    -- plus hundreds more.] \r\nRon studied Physiological reactions more than most
    scientists and applied it to invent a new Religion.\r\nHe did not invent but copied
    the laws of nature and scammed the whole world into thinking that he alone discovered
    these reactions and no one else did. What he did do - was noticed the reactions
    of students and from this scam invented Dianetics &acirc;&euro;&oelig;study tech&acirc;&euro;\x9D.\r\nExamples
    of Physiological reactions of the body and mind when reading:\r\nFalling asleep
    while reading - yawning, confusion, feeling blank, feeling anxious, not there
    feeling, tearing eyes, eyes going out of focus, dizziness, reeling, rebelliousness,
    headaches, skipping words, feeling nauseous, fidgeting, jumpy while reading, can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    stay still, mispronouncing words, feeling as if you are squashed, feeling as if
    you are over-whelmed, twitching, can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t apply what you are reading,
    can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t understand what you are reading, etc. are all due to
    physiological reactions when you read misunderstood words or misunderstood definitions.
    \ \r\n To understand the secrets of your enemy &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;is to know
    exactly where to hurt him.\r\nScientology&acirc;&euro;&trade;s copyrighted files
    on based upon the laws of Nature and laws of God; they are in violation of copyrights
    and patent rights. Therefore, the contents or subjects can be used by anyone and
    can be talked about without fear of any lawsuit.\r\nEverything you do produces
    a reaction in your body and mind. Every time you read, eat, sleep, rest, run,
    etc. produces a reaction. \r\nTo tell your mother that you invented a new religion,
    because you discovered why you farted, is a good example of the scam that Ron
    pulled on you. He got away with it because the world did not see these reactions
    as they applied to reading. Or if some scientist saw and knew it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he
    did not protest it and allowed a Cult to claim it as their own new discovery.\r\nIf
    you want to destroy the cult, study your own reactions each time you do something&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;learn
    to read yourself and use your own power of obnosis to discover the real world
    within you.\r\n\r\nYours truly\r\n\r\nRonbotHunter\r\nAll Rights Reserved.\r\n\t\t\r\nCopyright

  content: ! "Well this has been an interesting past few days - since New Year's Eve
    - 2009&#47;2010. I met this chap who said he was in the \"telecom industry\" and
    since I've built a software program for that industry (which I have yet to complete
    and subsequently market), I thought perhaps I should meet up with him. \r\n\r\nSo
    met the guy on a Saturday at a local Starbucks. A female \"associate\" of his
    showed up shortly afterward. Both of them were wearing suits -- on a Saturday
    right after New Year's Day. Across the street was a Hilton hotel where they were
    going to some \"business meeting.\" I was invited.\r\n\r\nSo I went and it turned
    out to be an ACN rally meeting. GROAN. I had never hear of ACN before that day.
    As a side note these ACN \"reps\" actually had to PAY to get IN! The bloe who'd
    invited me paid the $4 entry fee for me.\r\n\r\nSo I sat there politely, eagerly
    waiting for my opportunity to \"exit stage left.\" This environment was the usual
    get-rich-quick fare you see on late-night TV hawking real-estate courses with
    no-money-down, complete with a large video screen playing testimonials of successful
    nobodies. The last shot of the video is Donald Trump telling the audience, you're
    either a loser or a winner and by not jumping on this bandwagon, you're essentially
    a loser.  Then you had all the clones in suits clapping. After that a speaker
    comes up on the stage. And though he's got great stage presence, there's also
    something sort of contrived about him as well. He was apparently a successful
    lawyer who had been able to \"reach the same 1,000's of $$ in 3 years with ACN
    that had taken him 18 years of law practice to achieve.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there are
    always a few people like this. There are always a FEW people who could sell snow
    the Eskimos and for f**k's sake ... he's a f**king LAWYER! Why trust THAT guy?!
    lol\r\n\r\nThe fallacy here is:\r\nJust because a FEW people are hugely successful
    with ACN that ANY and ALL people can be equally successful. This is an incorrect
    and false conclusion that the bulk of ACN suckers  succumb to.\r\n\r\nThe last
    time I got roped into an MLM was about 20 years ago. I was really gung-ho about
    it and failed miserably. Beyond that, and much more importantly, I was asked to
    \"believe more strongly.\" And as a result of this, ended up alienating family
    and friends. \r\n\r\nThe reasoning goes a bit like this:\r\n\"You should really
    believe in this product&#47;program 100% and if someone in your life doesn't support
    you, they are just losers who don't want you to be successful.\"\r\n\r\nIt therefore
    becomes not only a religion, but a cult. This causes a person's mind to create
    an artificial division between \"us\" and \"them.\" The \"winners\" and the \"losers.\"
    \r\n\r\nAnd over what? Some sub-standard, over-priced MLM product that 99% of
    the population can do without and never miss.\r\n\r\nEven while in the presence
    of these ACN people I felt like I was in the midst of a cult. Just something unnatural
    about it. There's something very clone-like about them. And if you really look
    at the program from the top-down this is actually by design. This is what I might
    call the Zombie Business Model. Create 1 Zombie and get that Zombie to create
    2 Zombies below him. Rinse and repeat.\r\n\r\nSo upon returning home, I began
    to research ACN, something I didn't have the benefit of doing while at the \"training
    seminar.\" My suspicions were confirmed. \r\n\r\nBeyond that I was vaguely reminded
    the 2 or 3 encounters (back in the mid 90's) I've had with members of the Church
    of Scientology. And this lead me to examine what is now available on the web on
    them and other cults.\r\n\r\nPrincipally it led me to discover the top generals
    of Scientology, David Miscavige and Tommy Davis. Interestingly they both appear
    to have the same artificial, overbearing, in-your-face personalities. In fact,
    I'd almost argue these are not personalities at all, but the absence of personality.
    Tom Cruise seems to have devolved into this same kind of non-human. \r\n\r\nAND
    -- based upon my observations, both recently and over the years, I'd even go so
    far as to say that cults (both Scientology and MLMs) are all about the destruction
    of personality. Positive thinking and looking at the glass as half-full is one
    thing, but only insofar as it is helpful, and doesn't blind people to a wider
    spectrum of possibilities. \r\n\r\nA simple example is the development and implementation
    of passenger safety in automobiles. Before this science was invented, it was commonly
    thought that survival of collision was largely \"the will of God.\" \r\n\r\nSure,
    you can go about saying to yourself, \"Only people who THINK they will get into
    a collision WILL, so all I have to do is think the right thoughts.\" By doing
    this you have restricted yourself to one set of eventualities. You don't allow
    yourself to contemplate, \"What if I get into a crash?\" The balanced mind allows
    for both eventualities. \"I don't expect to get into a crash, but IF I do, I'm
    preparing for the small chance by 1) buying a safer car 2) using my seat belt
    3) etc.\" By doing this, you reduce the impact of unforeseen events.\r\n\r\nWhile
    ACN is not as dangerous or destructive to an individual or his&#47;her family
    as Scientology, there is definitely a certain amount of overlap. By their very
    design - recruit family &amp; friends and divorcing oneself from non-believers
    - a schism is created.\r\n\r\nTo anyone who is seriously considering \"joining\"
    ACN, I would advise you to look deeper within yourself. What are your special
    talents and abilities? Why were you put here on this planet? To sell plastic video-phones?
    (yesterday's technology btw) Or is there something you'd much rather do? What
    is it that you can share with the world that will give you and the others around
    you joy and happiness?"

  content: here in Dallas we have Millenium3 education. i know a few people who are
    doing it and all they tell me is "if i told you how it has worked for me, you
    wouldn't get the same result" that's the same thing scientologists' will tell
    you. scientology has so many secrets because it has so much b&#47;s that only
    the desperate would want to believe. millenium3, from what has been posted by
    ex-members, is a very expensive hard-sell and you are expected to see improvements
    or there is something wrong with YOU. again like scientology.

<blockquote>Wow dan. I was very interested in your post, until you attacked Ravi about how he responded to you. Oops&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; look I did it to. Compliment you on your post&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; wow, I must be trying to manipulate the argument. And then to throw Scientology into it? A bit intelectually off center, don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t you think?
I am interested in knowing if the Iris 3000 supports other protocals. In fact I found this forum because I was looking ot see if there was any way for me to use Skype video to call a video phone, and not just another Skype user. Any information would be helpful&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; thanks! (and lay off attacking others, just provide information, it gives you greater credibility&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; just look at our presidential race for guidance)<&#47;blockquote>
My response below:
<blockquote>Hi Matsonian,

You make a good point - I was rather too cynical about Ravi's post. But then again, he's an ACN reseller, so don't I have reason to be?

I think my language was too negative. I do (in real life) tend to be the kind of person that gives others the benefit of the doubt, however everyone knows the online world can tempt us to vent for its own sake ;-)

The comparison with Scientology is actually valid, in my opinion. Scientologists (and I have spoken with quite a few over the years, at various levels of the organisation) are often trained using very particular negotiating techniques that typically represent a bit of traditional marketing, a bit of religious hyperbole, and some aspects of NLP.

Let me also make the point that there are many other organisations that operate similarly to ACN and to Scientology. I'm singling these out as case studies rather than saying "they're the only two organisations in the world that practise network marketing". Also, there are many distinctions between them, and I would agree that Scientology is much more insidious and generally crap for society. Nevertheless, a valid comparison can be made.

My first personal encounter with an ACN representative was very, very similar to encounters with Scientologists. He misrepresented his business to get me to come to the table (Scientologists do so using "free IQ tests"), and then used this opporunity to try and sell me mobile phone plans. I tried to find out more about his business model and plans, however at every point where a matter of hard facts was raised (e.g. "is this phone compatible with video phones from other manufacturers? Does it use the standards?") he referred to material that was unavailable ("Oh, I'd have to ask my boss that", or "that's in the fine print", or "I'm sure it's compatible, but you'd have to check with head office"). The Scientologists respond in similar ways, though they also use that as an opportunity to sell you books ("You'd have to read the book to find that out").

In addition, both Scientology and ACN exploit relationships with friends and family to grow their network (I'm not singling either out exclusively here - many other organisations do this too). Scientology does this by drawing a clear distinction between those that are potentially open to scientology, and those that are clearly not going to embrace it (they call them "suppressive personalities"). Scientology encourages you not to socialise at all with people who think Scientology is a load of crap.

ACN exploits familial relationships by encouraging members to recruit family and friends to be representatives of ACN. In fact, the whole focus of the organisation is heavily weighted towards growing the network over actually selling products. ACN members, I am sure, will be worded up on tactics to identify those that are open to this opportunity, and then either shut down or shut out those that aren't.

I could go on, but I'm late for ice skating.

Thanks for reading my site! I'm sorry that my harsh response invalidated for you what was otherwise a fairly reasonable argument.

Cheers,
Dan<&#47;blockquote>
