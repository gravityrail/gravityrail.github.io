Good ol' <a href="http://no-sword.sieve.net">Matt</a> is right on the money with <a href="http://no-sword.sieve.net/archives/2004_01_25_index.html#107510954608820644">this post</a>.

Not only is a one-way manned trip to Mars viable, I think the concept is much much cooler than a wooncy two-way trip. My pick for first one-way mission: China. They have a strong precedent for self-sacrifice, and an overwhelming desire to prove themselves to the rest of the world.

Bring on gene-therapy so I can make myself into a Chinaman!
