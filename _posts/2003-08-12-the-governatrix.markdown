Arnie may be hogging the limelight, but there's only one candidate running for Governer of California that I'd vote for: <a href="http://www.georgyforgov.com/">Georgy</a>! She's a Computer Science graduate from UC Berkeley and, not to demean her intellectual achievements, she's also rather cute. I'd love to be <i>her</i> candi<b>date</b>!<br />
