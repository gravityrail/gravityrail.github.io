  content: ! "Love that you entertain yourself writing poetry.\r\nHappiness is a comic
    bloke\r\nAlways ready with a joke\r\nTickling bones of other folks\r\nSometimes
    going up in smoke\r\nReady fun at self to poke\r\nRarely found to ever choke\r\nLoving
    dagger and the cloak\r\nMakes us laugh until we croak\r\nHappiness is the comic
    bloke :-)"

I just authored this on a plane, while sitting in an exit row, in honour of Exit Rows everywhere.

I'm 6'6" / 200cm. You get the idea.

<strong>Happiness is an Exit Row</strong>

Happiness is an Exit Row
With knees not shifting to and fro
With  aching not felt from below
Nor seat-backs crushing hips-to-toes
I do so love you Exit Row

Happiness is an Exit Row
With room  to stage a puppet show
While dressed as Edgar Allen Poe
With <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">daughter</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">cousin</span> wife in tow
Oh! How I love my Exit Row

Happiness is an Exit Row
Should you steal it, you're my foe
The  handle pulled, the door I'll blow
Released your belt and out you go
I'd kill to have my Exit Row

Oh, how I <strong>love</strong> my Exit Row!
