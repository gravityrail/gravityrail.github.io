Who says there's no money to be made with <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=5508453273">original art</a>?
<blockquote>I will not be responsible for the duck after shipping, I will not field questions or help to explain its unusual mystique. I want nothing to do with it. The winning bidder must understand this. I don't want someone to find this thing in a Dumpster or buy it at a garage sale, I want the person who gets it to understand what they have and not to take it lightly, and for Gods sake I don't want it near children. I'd be just as happy if you buried it in the Tupperware container it's still in.</blockquote>
First clowns, now this?
