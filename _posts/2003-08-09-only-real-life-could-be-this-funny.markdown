Fresh from the <a href="http://no-sword.sieve.net">gayest</a> blog on the web (by which I mean <a href="http://www.gay.com">happy</a>) comes news of the <a href="http://www.bongheritagecenter.org/">Dick Bong heritage center</a>, a museum dedicated to the heroic wartime exploits of one Richard I. Bong. As I type this I am sliding onto the floor, tears streaming down my face, thinking that if this is how I have to die, well, it comes a close second to cyborg decapitation.<br />
