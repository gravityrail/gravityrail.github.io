<p>Tomorrow night is a landmark in television, for that is when Planet Nerd Episode 3 goes to air. After a rollercoaster week which saw us become the #1 comedian on YouTube (take <b>THAT<&#47;b> kitten-that-almost-says-hello!), we return with our biggest show yet!<&#47;p>

<ul>
<li>Dan Walmsley reports pseudo-live from Steve Jobs' keynote speech at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference<&#47;li>
<li>Paul Verhoeven and Ben McKenzie investigate the brainy world of Zombies<&#47;li> 
<li>Simon Barber brings us the Weekly Whedon<&#47;li>
<li>Musical parody heaven from Anyone for Tennis<&#47;li>
<li>And so much more!<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>

<p>As usual, you can catch us at 10pm on Channel 31 Melbourne. If you miss that, we're on again at 1am Saturday night<&#47;p>
