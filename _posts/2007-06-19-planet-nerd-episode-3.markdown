<p>Tomorrow night is a landmark in television, for that is when Planet Nerd Episode 3 goes to air. After a rollercoaster week which saw us become the #1 comedian on YouTube (take <b>THAT</b> kitten-that-almost-says-hello!), we return with our biggest show yet!</p>

<ul>
<li>Dan Walmsley reports pseudo-live from Steve Jobs' keynote speech at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference</li>
<li>Paul Verhoeven and Ben McKenzie investigate the brainy world of Zombies</li>
<li>Simon Barber brings us the Weekly Whedon</li>
<li>Musical parody heaven from Anyone for Tennis</li>
<li>And so much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual, you can catch us at 10pm on Channel 31 Melbourne. If you miss that, we're on again at 1am Saturday night</p>

L8rz,<br />

Host and Patsy-in-Chief, Planet Nerd
