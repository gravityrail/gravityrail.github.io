There's a great piece in Salon about Alexandra Pelosi (Nancy Pelosi's daughter) and her travels with conservatives in the waning days of the 2008 election.

It's notable for its sympathetic view of the motivations and feelings of those 58 million Americans who didn't want Barack Obama as their president, and see those t-shirts bearing his image as reminiscent of "Castro's Cuba".

Definitely worth checking out: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.salon.com&#47;ent&#47;tv&#47;int&#47;2009&#47;02&#47;16&#47;alexandra_pelosi&#47;">Watching Republicans Grieve<&#47;a>.
