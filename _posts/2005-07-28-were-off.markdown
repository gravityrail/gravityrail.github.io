    baby-sling, toys, formula, wipes, cream, juice, socks, little cardigan, t-shirts
    for bub, spare singlets-boots-socks-cardigan and t-shirts. You'll need his pants
    too, and a cocoon for the little baby, muesli bars, camera, teething ring, baby-sunscreen,
    fruit and biscuits... and don't forget a towel for if the littly vomits after
    feeding and the boy will need a dummy if he's going to have a sleep and that'll
    mean he needs pyjamas, and spare pyjamas in case the nappy leaks....\r\n\r\nwhere
    are we going again?"

It's 1:21am, I am still packing. It's not a difficult process (though realising that I left all my decent underwear at a friend's house hasn't helped), but it's going very slowly as every little article brings forth a wave of memories and emotion. 

I am taking a surprisingly small amount of stuff. Really. Three bags: one small, one medium, one large. Is that all I need?

I feel stupid and tired.
