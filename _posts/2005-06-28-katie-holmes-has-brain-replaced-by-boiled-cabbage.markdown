  content: Fortunately we have blogs now, so they won't be allowed to get away with
    it. "Suspicious behavior in Hollywood? Not on my shift!" the police will cry,
    before leaping into their cars and screaming off to the Cruisecave. Meanwhile
    Tom Cruise tosses a tablet PC aside in a fury, its screen still showing an Australian
    blog linking to a news article. "BLOOOOOOOOOOOGS!" he roars.

  content: ! "Uh... when I said \"not get away with it\", I probably should have said
    \"People will not only realise that Cruise and Holmes have become extremely kooky,
    but will be able to amass a compelling body of evidence to <em>prove</em>
    it.\"\r\n\r\nMore sources of information = less ability for Cruise's management
    to engage in damage control.\r\n\r\nOf course, the fact that he <em>fired</em>
    his management will also impede their ability to engage in damage control.\r\n\r\nStupid
    munchkin."

I'm not normally one to regurgitate celebrity gossip, but one story has me very concerned. The <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,160192,00.html">16 missing days</a> between the Old Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise's infatuated new Bride-Bot.

<blockquote>... Sometime that week, her friends say, she flew to Los Angeles for a meeting with Cruise about a role in "Mission: Impossible 3." The meeting took place after April 11.

The next time anyone heard from Holmes was on April 27, when she appeared in public as Cruise's girlfriend and love of his life.

Where was she during those 16 days?

Somewhere during that time, she decided to fire both her manager and agent, each of whom she had been with for years and who were devoted to her.</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,160192,00.html">Read the article</a>. This is just awful. And the new Tom Cruise has been coming across in interviews as, well, <a href="http://www.thesuperficial.com/archives/000996.html">completely bananas</a>.

In the days before blogs, they might very well have got away with this.
