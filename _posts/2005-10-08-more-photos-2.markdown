Anyone in the mood for more repetitive, mostly un-rotated photos from my snap-happy tour of the increasingly Far East should check out <a href="http://goldsounds.com/gallery/v/Europe-2005/Bulgaria/">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="http://goldsounds.com/gallery/v/Europe-2005/Turkey/">Turkey</a> galleries.

Everyone else can just shut the hell up.
