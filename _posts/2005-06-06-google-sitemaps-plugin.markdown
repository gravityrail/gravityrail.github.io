I feel compelled to post this, because I think it's a great idea that deserves to be widely adopted: <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/stats">Google Sitemaps</a> is a system which allows the Google Crawler to crawl your site more efficiently by telling it the frequency with which sections of the site are updated.

In record time, the Arne Brachold and the Wordpress community have <a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/2005/06/05/google-sitemaps-generator-v2-final">produced a plugin</a> which generates the sitemap automatically. Very impressive!

A win-win situation - I really wish more companies would observe the example of Google in this case. They really seem to understand the web community better than most others out there.
