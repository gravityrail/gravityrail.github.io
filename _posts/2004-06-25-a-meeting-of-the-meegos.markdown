This afternoon, <a href="http://www.3hgroup.com">3hgroup</a> had a meeting about my site. They sat in the boardroom and discussed my pissant blog. Between 3 and 5pm Australian Eastern Standard time, they viewed the <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/6/4/meegos-are-cool/">Meegos page</a> alone at least 7 times, god knows how many times they <em>actually</em> viewed it given the likelihood that it's cached by the IIS proxy running on their <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/6/23/sorry-i-was-pretty-far-off-the-mark/">Windows 2003 Server</a>  (which they utterly failed to firewall).

They also viewed the main page at least ten times. Jeez - my blog doesn't change that often guys, give it a rest!

For those just joining us, <a href="http://www.3hgroup.com">3hgroup</a> started <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/6/4/meegos-are-cool/#comment-66">astroturfing</a> their <a href="http://www.meegos.com">lame Meegos product</a> on my site, pretending to be a "passionate fan" and insulting my intelligence (not to mention implying I'm unemployed), then <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/6/22/i-can-hardly-breathe/">openly praised themselves</a> as another fake user. When I told them I was onto them, they <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/6/23/correction/#comment-84">insisted I was off the mark</a>, but of course they haven't posted since I proved they were <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/6/23/sorry-i-was-pretty-far-off-the-mark/">full of shit</a>.

I have <strong>never</strong> had so much fun online.

Oh and another thing - my <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/6/4/meegos-are-cool/">meegos page</a> is starting to get a serious amount of traffic.
