For the last few months, I've had a regular TV spot on Channel 31's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.thebreakfastshow.net.au&#47;">Breakfast Show Live<&#47;a> as the Geek of the Week (though it's actually fortnightly).

This morning, my topic was the History of the Web. I've posted the transcript online for dissection and ridicule. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.danwalmsley.com&#47;breakfast-show-live&#47;a-history-of-the-web&#47;">Enjoy<&#47;a>!
