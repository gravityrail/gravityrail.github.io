I've fallen for the tagged web. It's just so... useful! Sets of tags attached to everything that's published (photos on <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a>, bookmarks on <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, and just plain everything on <a href="http://www.technorati.com">technorati</a>). This is my first post to be pinged through to technorati, and you'll note that all my posts from now on have a bunch of tags at the bottom to help you explore the Tagged Web.

More news as it comes in. God I'm lame.
