This just in: American government overtly hypocritical.

In his recent Veterans' Day speech, Bush <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200511/s1505114.htm">accused critics of the Iraq war of trying to rewrite history</a>. Of course, the Bush Whitehouse knows just what that's like, because just days before the speech they rewrote the transcript of a Whitehouse press conference, and then tried to <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/politics/white-house/index.php#the-white-houses-war-on-transcripts-136039">shove their altered version of reality</a> down the throats of other agencies that provide independant transcripts.

The rewritten section has Scott McClellan saying "No, I don't think that's accurate", rather than what he actually said: "That's accurate". The Bush Whitehouse is behaving as though we live in an age before video, despite the fact that they're <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/10/20051031-3.v.html">serving it up</a> alongside <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/10/20051031-3.html">their bogus transcript</a>. Go in about 5:30.

So, what's good for the Goose is no longer good for the Gander? Hopefully, this story becomes a big fat Thanksgiving turkey for the Bush regime. I may stretch the analogy, but not as far as they've stretched the truth.

There I go again!
