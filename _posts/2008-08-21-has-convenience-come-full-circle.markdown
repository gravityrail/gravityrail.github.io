An ad spotted on Facebook:

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/phelpsad.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-142" title="Phelps Ad" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/phelpsad.png" alt="" width="184" height="250" /></a>

WTF? Michael Phelps? Isn't the point of fad diets that they're <strong>easier</strong> than becoming an Olympian?
