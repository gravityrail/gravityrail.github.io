In the next post down, you can see that meegos has some pretty harsh words for me:
<blockquote>you are so off the mark my friend&#8230;.but its funny to listen to and watch&#8230; just let me know if you would like updates in the future..P.S. your obviously an extremely dedicated employee, your posts are all done from your apparent work ! your messages also scream of someone with way too much time on there hands&#8230;</blockquote>
Yeah, I'm pretty far off the mark with my assertions about you working for 3hgroup considering all your comments come from <strong>their intranet</strong>.

Good grief, how stupid do you think I am?

I don't really have a lot of time on my hands, but I'm having so much fun it's hard to stop. Besides, I worked 'til 2am last night, and the night before - work <em>owes</em> me this ;-)

<strong>update!</strong>

Meegos has <a href="http://203.31.219.111/archives/2004/6/4/meegos-are-cool/#comment-85">commented</a> on the original post - this time with just a link to a Sydney Morning Herald <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/04/10/1018333365189.html?oneclick=true">article</a>  that talks about how much Dave Heysen sold Soulmates for. Jeez - sensitive much?

My response, to save typing:
<blockquote>Ok, this is just awesome, just AWESOME. I was browsing the logs and saw that Dave had just posted - hi Dave!

a) meego just confirmed that he&#8217;s Dave Heysen (or someone who knows him) by posting a link bragging about how he sold Soulmates for $23 million
b) Someone who just made $23 million still finds it necessary to brag about it on a blog noone reads - self esteem issues Dave?
c) I never said Soulmates / match.com went nowhere - I _knew_ it was sold for a packet. I still contend that TVMates was a dismal flop, considering the anecdotal evidence that www.tvmates.com is a spam site, and nothing&#8217;s been mentioned of it since the trial press release circa 2000.
d) You&#8217;re still pretending to be &#8220;meegos&#8221;? Give it up, dude!

This is so going on the front page. </blockquote>

Wheee!
