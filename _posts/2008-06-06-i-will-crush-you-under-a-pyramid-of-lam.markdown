    a section called "Nope, not a baby-eater. No babies eaten since 1984, promise."
    because, you know, I'm NOT a baby-eater, so I don't need a section on the website

    going to retire from it in a couple of months. So far they have made some money,

    don't talk about it anymore or we argue.

  content: You are a fool no offense my friend but you don't understand the concept
    of the video phone or the way the business works and that's a shame. It is not
    a pyramid scheme because pyramids are illegal in a lot of countries including
    my own. I don't know about yours but this company is in 20 different countries
    all around the world and i have had no complaints with my customers and people
    who have chosen ACN as there provider. This is not a get rich quick so if that's
    what you were looking for right off the bat then i am sorry to say that nothing
    in life is that easy. This is simple you sell EXISTING services wireless, local
    and long distance, TV etc. If you recall way back bell was the only option for
    Internet and home phone, do to deregulation it opened up the doors for other companies
    like Sprint, Rogers, AT&amp;T etc.... ACN is just another one of those options.
    The difference is they have a method that bypasses advertising, marketing and
    mass mailing which costs millions a day to allow people like myself and others
    to acquire customers themselves and by doing so putting themselves in a position
    to earn a percentage of there customers bills every time they pay them. This is
    legit the start up fee is basically a license to sell telecommunication services
    and telus phones and plans, like any license you want to acquire there is a fee.
    ACN takes care of all customer service all technical service and all the things
    nobody wants to do when they open there own business. Try opening up your own
    Telus phone booth and see how much it costs you i guarantee that it is nowhere
    near $500. This is your own business you have the ability to sell all the services
    that you use today and the services of the future, your going to pay for them
    anyways why not make some money off of it.

    As of (9/1/2010) yes it is.\r\n\r\nHowever, THIS IS NOT THE ONLY PRODUCT
    THAT ACN HAS!\r\n\r\nACN also has cell phones which cost less than the carriers
    offer (phones are less, provider plans are identical).  ACN offers Satellite TV
    services Direct TV and Dish Network for less than on the open market by $5-10/mo
    (depending on the plan).  ACN offers ADT Home Security, for the same monthly service,
    but installation is free.  (Some ADT contractors charge $350!)\r\nACN offers Landline
    for less than the local provider, by almost $10 (depending on plan features).\r\n\r\nMore

    \ \r\nACN will be adding Gas and Electric by the end of the year.  In Canada,
    this results in around a 10% discount monthly on utility bills.\r\n\r\nI am a
    former Real Estate Broker, and I got involved in ACN around 8 months ago.  Things
    were slow in the beginning as it was moderately difficult to get the ball rolling.
    \ But in my 4th month I got my first check for $185.  My 4th month, it was around
    $400.  My 5th month $635, My 6th month $961, my 7th month $1400(ish), and my 8th
    month ($1822).  My goal for my 9th month is $2500, and my Real Estate brokerage
    is currently for sale.  \r\n\r\nWhen I opened my brokerage, I didn't make a profit
    for around 18 months.  And it cost me over $20k to start.  \r\n\r\nIn closing,
    I'm sorry if some presenters \"push\" the video phone(s).  But as I read this
    post was authored in 2008, perhaps you should take a second look at ACN."

So I was at a seminar the other day on starting a business, and a (very) young guy called Francis approached me afterwards and struck up a conversation. He seemed sincere enough, and said he was part of a VoIP Video business. Intrigued, I agreed to meet him for lunch 2 days later.

That meeting was today.

Some context: I am interested in VoIP video-conferencing at the moment because (a) I've been broadcasting live events using various technologies, and I'm always interested in new ones, and (b) a few friends are interested in integrating video conferencing into their businesses.

The first thing I asked was "how does the technology work, what protocols does it use?". I was shown a brochure whose only mention of technology was accompanied by the word "proprietary", which immediately rang alarm bells.

The entire history of the PSTN has been a fight against proprietary communications networks. They are the enemy of connectivity and utility. They are a technological leech, a barrier to communication creating problems where none should exist.

By the way, we do have open standards for video conferencing. They're called SIP and H.264, or H.323, or whatever. They work well enough. My friends and I can buy different SIP-phones and still talk to each other. By contrast, proprietary protocols are the bugle-call of the Cavalrey of Lock-In Hell.

I asked him to tell me what these proprietary protocols were, and he had no idea. He called his boss, and his boss (allegedly) had no idea. Uh-oh.

So I proceeded to tell him that I wasn't interested, and he said "let me show you this DVD, it might explain the technology". Right.

The DVD showed a lot of people driving fancy cars, and living in enormous homes filmed through vaseline-covered lenses, populated by actors who run the gamut of ethnic backgrounds and age groups. No dice.

The owner (or some other senior guy) comes on.

"ACN will become the biggest company in the world."

<em>Alarm bells.</em>

Then, Donald Trump comes on. Donald Trump! Now there's a man whose image conjures up respect. For the death penalty. For white-collar crime. When the revolution comes.

Trump opined: "ACN offers a great opportunity for you to start your own business with none of the risk and costs associated with starting a normal business.".

<em>Louder alarm bells.</em>

He went on: "In the coming years, the video phone market could become bigger than the property market."

<em>Alarm bells so loud they alter the orbits of nearby satellites.</em>

I clicked the next menu item. Ooh! A bit about the phone!

It's just a video phone. You can only talk to other people using the same video phone. You can make normal phone calls with it too. Nice, but kinda useless and not exactly revolutionary.

The video stops and I still know nothing.

My first question: "What makes you think people are going to pay $30 a month for a video phone service when they can get the same thing for free with their PC and a webcam?"

"Sure", says the kid, "Telstra make money don't they? We charge the same way they do.". Uh, yes, and Telstra has a government-granted monopoly. This is not exactly comparing apples to apples.

I go on for a while about how proprietary consumer-level VoIP is a stupid idea, and then it hits me: he's not asking me to use their tech; he's asking me to be a reseller. And not just any reseller - a multi-level marketing reseller.

That's right, folks. ACN is a pyramid scheme. Note that I said <em>scheme</em>, not scam. They <em>are</em> legal (they barely escaped prosecution for violating the Trade Practises Act of 1974), but they're also extremely deceptive and when you run the numbers it's simply not possible for the vast majority of participants to make money. I didn't have a calculator in front of me at the time but I told this kid that I reckoned only the top 30% make any money, and that the top 5% make 95% of the money.

Turns out my guesstimate wasn't far off. And I wasn't even including the vast array of hidden fees that you can find listed <a href="http://arbyte.us/blog_archive/2005/04/ACN_Pyramid_Scam.html">elsewhere</a>.

So I tackle this with Francis, and he seems a little perturbed but presses on. It turns out they also sell mobile and fixed line telecommunications products.

Ok, so they sell:

(a) A product nobody wants (proprietary videophones that don't talk SIP), and
(b) A product so commoditised that there's practically no margin in it (mobile and fixed line phone plans)

But the common link between these two products? They're both new enough that normal people don't understand the market dynamics yet. They think they're getting in "ahead of the curve", when in fact they're taking a sharp turn off a cliff.

I could go on, but I won't. Suffice it to say: They won't be getting my $500 sign-up fee. They won't be convincing me to sell stuff to my friends they don't need. They won't have a chance to lock me into bizarre non-compete contracts that take any hope of true business initiative away from me (you can't do your own marketing. You can't cold-call. You can't approach suppliers directly. Etc).

And, hopefully now that I've written this, they won't have any more customers or representatives in Australia. Fingers crossed.
