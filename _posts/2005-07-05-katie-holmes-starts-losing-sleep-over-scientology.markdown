<a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/people/tom-katie-always-together/2005/07/04/1120329367051.html">Yet more evidence</a> of the exponentially increasing creepyness of the unholy union of Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise:

<blockquote>Since Katie Holmes hooked up with Tom Cruise and the Scientologists, she's not allowed to be alone - ever.

When Holmes accompanied Cruise to a recent taping of The View, eyebrows were raised when she wasn't allowed to go to the bathroom alone.

At one point, Cruise asked where the bathroom was and "took Katie with him into the men's room," an insider told the New York Post.

Later, when Holmes needed to go, "three Scientologists followed her in."

A rep for the show said: "We don't follow guests to the bathroom."

Meanwhile, some star-watchers were also concerned because Holmes "looks like she hasn't slept in weeks."</blockquote>

Eek.
