Okay, so I'm a nerd. In general this is a good thing, but sometimes I catch myself thinking some fairly out-there thoughts. There's a tenuous statistical link between qualities traditionally associated with nerds (good at math, poor social skills etc) and some forms of autism. Today I found myself trying to remember how a song went called Spring that I'd heard at Cookie the other day... only to eventually recall that it was a beer, not a song. Cascade Spring something. All I could remember is that I'd really enjoyed it.<br />

Why is all the meat-furniture staring at me?<br />
