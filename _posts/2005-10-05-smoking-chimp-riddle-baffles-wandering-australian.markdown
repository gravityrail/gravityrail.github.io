  content: is this a spoof with two o's or three? I mean, it could be a spooof, but
    it's likely that it's just a spoof.

Primate-related mystery reported by Xinhua in Shaanxi, China, where a chimpanzee called "Ai Ai" (obviously named by Ali G on one of his regular visits to the region) has reportedly <a href="http://go.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=oddlyEnoughNews&storyID=9814329&src=rss/oddlyEnoughNews">quit smoking cigarettes</a>. Apparently, there is a good reason for the habit.

<blockquote>Xinhua attributed Ai Ai's habit to solitude and grief.</blockquote>

Now, I'm not the Lord of All that is Logical, but shouldn't the first question be "how the fuck did a chimp get hold of enough cigarettes to get addicted?". Oh, wait, they thought of that:

<blockquote>Xinhua did not say who had first given cigarettes to her or kept supplying them.</blockquote>

As usual, the Great Chinese Wall of Silence is hastily erected. The West is watching, chimp-killers!
