  content: ! "I don't get it - how am I off the mark? You just admitted that you're
    not who you say you are by posting as the same user but with a completely different
    tone/agenda. \r\n\r\nIf I'm off the mark, why don't you 'fess up to who you
    really are? You've obviously been pretending to be at least two different people
    (now three). By continuing to play these games all you're doing is allowing disinformation
    to be spread. \r\n\r\nMy posts have taken a grand total of half an hour to write
    - less than a lunch hour - and I work up to 18 hours a day. Not a large proportion
    of my time, really, for all the fun I'm having. \r\n\r\nSo instead of pretending
    like I'm an idiot for noticing that you've been lying repeatedly about who you
    are on my site, forging multiple identities with the agenda of promoting meegos
    (if you don't work for them, why the _hell_ would you bother?), why don't you
    just come clean? I'm sure we're all waiting with bated breath (that is, me, my
    friend Matt, and my girlfriend - who are the only other people who read this site).\r\n\r\nYou
    want to talk about funny, man, I've never laughed so much since you started this
    whole thing. And bear in mind, I can see you're doing more than listening and
    watching - you're posting and reading my site several times a day. Don't play
    the \"I'm cooler than you\" game with me - I have _nothing_ to lose. This site
    is a toy. Your site is your job."

The 3hgroup site  is hosted through Powertel (Sydney), but the <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/6/4/meegos-are-cool">meegos</a> poster came through TPGI (Also Sydney) - so they don't necessarily use the same provider - but they do live in the same town. Turns out <a href="http://www.apnic.net">apnic</a> is a better resource than xpenguin et al.
