Hi all, I just thought I'd let the world know that I've got 7 <a href="http://www.gmail.com">gmail</a> invitations left to give away, and I've run out of people to give them to. So if anyone out there wants a gmail invitation, contact me at goldsounds[nospam]@[nospam]gmail.com, obviously without the "nospam" bits.

Despite the ongoing security debate, it's a very interesting study in how to make a responsive web application. Gmail really is incredible technology.

<strong>update: </strong>Sorry to everyone who didn't get a gmail account - there's none left!
