Dave and I were having dinner tonight, and he mentioned my old Home Page of Terror. I still have no idea why I called it that, but anyway <a href="yoyo">here it is</a>. It was my Uni webpage. It's amazing how much of an Internet time-capsule it is; a midi-file playing on the front page, animated gifs, under-construction signs, ridiculous overuse of hideous textured backgrounds - how I've missed you all!

	<li>A <a href="yoyo/demoweb/Default.htm">demo page</a> I made for a school project - shows a degree of restraint not evident anywhere else in the site</li>

	<li>A site I made for a friend's band called <a href="yoyo/menagerie">Menagerie</a>. So... textured... and who publishes sound bites in WAV anymore? Even in an age when people are walk around dribbling multi-gigabyte hard drives from their trouser legs, <em>nobody</em> uses lossless audio.

	<li>The old <a href="yoyo/baobhan.html">Baobhan Sidhe homepage</a>! My friends' band. One of the first pages on the 'net whose content was entirely contained between two <CENTER> tags.</li>
	<li>Finally, lest my embarrassment not be complete, I present to you the <a href="yoyo/monologue.txt">first stand-up monologue I ever performed</a>. Take <str>that</str>, Goths! You nerdy outsiders from society who take on distinct attributes as a way of forming a strong and insular "tribe"! I mock your search for comfort in the company of like-minded friends, and your arbitrary collective behaviours!</li>
	<li>Interestingly, my friend Ashley's <a href="http://yoyo.its.monash.edu.au/~blackcat/">home page </a> is still up at Yoyo. And it still has pictures I drew in it, including the completely stupid <a href="http://yoyo.its.monash.edu.au/~blackcat/visible.html">Memoirs of a Visible Man</a>.</li>

Well, that was a blast from the past. Like a giant, non-standards-compliant fart of hand-coded HTML.

What? You want more? Well how about my <a href="yoyo/oldindex.html">even earlier web site</a>? Frames! The horror! For those who are interested, the bulbously phong-shaded logo was created using the extrude tool in Imagine 2.0 on an Amiga 1200 + 68030 @ 25MHz + 8Meg Fast RAM.

So, you saw the frames and you think you can handle some more hard-ass wayback-style Internet? Well, set your Flux Capacitors to 1994 and hit 88 as we view the <a href="yoyo/ind2.html">very first Home Page of Terror</a>! <strong>WRITTEN IN vi</strong>!
