While I acknowledge that the Huffington Post attracts a mostly left-wing authorship and readership, I think they hit the mark with a recent article about<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-rowe/the-holocaust-museum-shoo_b_214133.html"> hate speech in the media inciting actual violence</a>.

It seems to gel with my hunch about <a href="http://www.danwalmsley.com/2009/06/09/defining-culture-or-reflecting-it/">the real-world effects of outrageous public speech</a> in the quest for ratings and power.
