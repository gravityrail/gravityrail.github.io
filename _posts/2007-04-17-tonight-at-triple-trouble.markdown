<p>If you missed last night at Triple Trouble, then you missed Geraldine Quinn railing against the innocence of youth, Declan Fay railing against psychotic radio station call-ins and Matt Elsbury railing against... well, everything. And a Musical Odyssey about Lucinda the Angel of Death that went completely <b>off</b> the rails.</p>

<p><b>TONIGHT</b> (Wednesday) is <b>Super Science Night</b>! We have a packed line-up, including<br/>
<ul>
<li>the gorgeously hilarious Renata Muss</li>
<li>the sparklingly ramshackle Karin Muiznieks</li>
<li>the wildly witty Ben McKenzie (aka The Man in the Lab Coat)</li>
<li>the engagingly deranged Duff!</li>
<li>and the roaringly random Crew performing a totally made-up Instant Musical Odyssey</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Thursday</b> night is a Singing and Dancing Spectacular. Come on down and see:
<ul>
<li>Green Room award winning Cabaret Artist Geraldine Quinn</li>
<li>Groovy Interstate Musical Funsters "Hooray for Everything!"</li>
<li>The Crew, who will delight, surprise and possibly shock you with another Instant Musical Odyssey</li>
<li>Plus a Super Secret Dancing Surprise!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>To get in to either of these shows for just $5, just say the secret password "Mister Tickle" to our charming door-person.</p>

<p>Don't forget, Triple Trouble is on every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at The Laundry. 50 Johnston St, Fitzroy, from 8:30pm.</p>

<p>Cheerio Comedy Folk!</p>
