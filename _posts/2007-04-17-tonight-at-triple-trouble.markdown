<p>If you missed last night at Triple Trouble, then you missed Geraldine Quinn railing against the innocence of youth, Declan Fay railing against psychotic radio station call-ins and Matt Elsbury railing against... well, everything. And a Musical Odyssey about Lucinda the Angel of Death that went completely <b>off<&#47;b> the rails.<&#47;p>

<p><b>TONIGHT<&#47;b> (Wednesday) is <b>Super Science Night<&#47;b>! We have a packed line-up, including<br&#47;>
<ul>
<li>the gorgeously hilarious Renata Muss<&#47;li>
<li>the sparklingly ramshackle Karin Muiznieks<&#47;li>
<li>the wildly witty Ben McKenzie (aka The Man in the Lab Coat)<&#47;li>
<li>the engagingly deranged Duff!<&#47;li>
<li>and the roaringly random Crew performing a totally made-up Instant Musical Odyssey<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul><&#47;p>

<p><b>Thursday<&#47;b> night is a Singing and Dancing Spectacular. Come on down and see:
<ul>
<li>Green Room award winning Cabaret Artist Geraldine Quinn<&#47;li>
<li>Groovy Interstate Musical Funsters "Hooray for Everything!"<&#47;li> 
<li>The Crew, who will delight, surprise and possibly shock you with another Instant Musical Odyssey<&#47;li>
<li>Plus a Super Secret Dancing Surprise!<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>
<&#47;p>

<p>To get in to either of these shows for just $5, just say the secret password "Mister Tickle" to our charming door-person.<&#47;p>

<p>Don't forget, Triple Trouble is on every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at The Laundry. 50 Johnston St, Fitzroy, from 8:30pm.<&#47;p>

<p>Cheerio Comedy Folk!<&#47;p>
