    to deprive you of your rights through control and supression of free thought!
    Fight the power! What good is being happy if you don't have _truth_?

Daniel Haigh arrived early for work this morning, and the first thing he did was read my site. 8:28am - even millionaires have to get up early sometimes.

Sweet.

I wonder if 3hgroup still think <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/6/4/meegos-are-cool">astroturfing my blog</a> was a good idea?

And a big thanks to Liz, who <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/6/4/meegos-are-cool#comment-93">writes</a>:
<blockquote>I was goin 2 go and get meegos but nw i starting 2 think its not such a good idea</blockquote>
Starting to think is one of the most rewarding things you'll ever do, Liz.
