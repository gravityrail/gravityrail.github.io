As if our salaries weren't enough (*snort*!), skinny nerds now have more sexual ammunition to fire at foxy females that catch our thick horn-rimmed spectacles: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/science/07/31/mates.big.small.reut/index.html">sexually experienced women like weedy guys</a>. <br />
<br />
Of course, the fact that most scientists are skinny, weedy guys has nothing to do with the constant stream of research talking up the merits of nerd-mating.
