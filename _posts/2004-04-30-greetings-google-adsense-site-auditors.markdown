I read today on <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> that Google is (finally!) having an IPO. I browsed their online <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504073639/ds1.htm">S-1</a> form and found a reference to a thing called "<a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">AdSense</a>", which gives you a little bit of money every time someone clicks a google ad on your site, so I signed up. What the heck, you only live once, right? Then they tell me via e-mail that their people are going to audit my site in order to see if it's appropriate. "No worries", I thought, "it's not as though my site is filled with porn and warez".

Perhaps not, but on the front page I found:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://203.31.219.111/archives/2004/4/19/g00g3--0rz/">How to hack people's computers <em>using Google</em></a></li>
	<li><a href="http://203.31.219.111/archives/2004/3/29/under-the-hammer-someone-to-hammer-your-unders/">A story about selling underage prostitutes on E-Bay</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://203.31.219.111/archives/2004/3/7/bukkake-is-all-i-have-left/">A comic about Bukkake</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://203.31.219.111/archives/2004/3/7/license-to-kill-time/">A number plate that says "I fucked your wife"</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://203.31.219.111/archives/2004/2/18/i-have-a-new-favourite-word/">An entire post dedicated to the word "fucktastically"</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://203.31.219.111/archives/2004/2/18/i-found-it/">A Nigger Owner's Manual (tongue-in-cheek, but nevertheless...)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://203.31.219.111/archives/2004/2/17/theyre-gape-a-licious/">Cookies explicity designed to look like gaping, overused assholes</a></li>
</ul>

And <em>that's just on the front page</em>!

More than any ad revenue, I fear for my sanity and moral hygiene.
