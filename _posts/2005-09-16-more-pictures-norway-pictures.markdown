I have begun the long and arduous process of uploading all my photos. Yes, there are many duplicates and crappy pictures and boring pictures, but that's what you get with digital photography. I haven't had a chance to go through and rate them or cull the pointless ones yet, but I hope you find them interesting anyway.

Some more in <a href="http://goldsounds.com/gallery/Scotland">Scotland</a>, and a new one called <a href="http://goldsounds.com/gallery/Norway">Norway</a>.

Love,
Dan
