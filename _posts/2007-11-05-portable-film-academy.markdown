Last weekend I was lucky enough to be part of the inaugural Portable Film Academy. Thanks to Andrew Apostola and all the crew, helpers, speakers and other attendees it was a great weekend and I really learned a lot.

The core task for the weekend was to create an original online series, and below you can watch Episode 1 of our series called "Forever". This was produced by myself, Johnny Blank and Sebastian Goldspink.

Also a huge thanks to our star Oliver Clark, who was just brilliant as Karl. He nailed every scene in one or two takes, which was great because we were under a lot of time pressure.
