There's something I've been working on recently as part of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.agentblank.com">Agent Blank<&#47;a> that I'm really, really proud of, and now that we've got a few episodes under our belt I'm ready to share it with the world. 

It's called "Chloe Hall: Show on the Road" and it's a web series shot entirely by the band while on the road, and edited by our little team of miscreants here in Melbourne, Johnny Blank and Benjamin Murphy.

I hope you really enjoy it. The player is embedded below (I hope this works!). You can view the whole series at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.chloehall.com.au&#47;show-on-the-road">Chloe's web site<&#47;a>.
