I love press-releases, particularly ones that try to invert reality and turn a lame-duck company into an unstoppable profit-generating powerhouse. So it goes with the irrepressible <a href="http://3hgroup.com">3hgroup</a>, makers of <a href="http://www.meegos.com">Meegos</a> and, uh, <a href="http://3hgroup.com/products.cfm">not much else</a>.

I've spoken of Meegos before, so it may be fun to <a href="http://goldsounds.com/index.php?s=meegos&submit=Search">delve into the past</a> before reading further.

<a href="http://3hgroup.com/news.cfm?n=2">Their latest missive</a> (Late-May 2005) proclaims vociferously the "Rapid uptake of Meegos(TM) for MSN Messenger 7", and then <em>completely fails</em> to list any of the following:
<ul>
	<li>sales figures</li>
	<li>revenues</li>
	<li>advertising expenditure (i.e. exposure)</li>
	<li><strong>anything at all</strong> that would indicate whether their business is performing well, by any objective measure.</li>
</ul>

While listing only the following:
<ul>
	<li>Current number of users of MSN (155 million), as a potential market</li>
</ul>

You know, the potential market for <em>my website</em> is every single person on the Internet, and do you know how many people visit it? Go on, have a guess. I can assure you, it isn't countless millions.

Oh, and I would just like to point out that, yet again, I am bringing the Google smackdown on 3hgroup's head - I'm the 6th result for Meegos and the 4th for 3hgroup, and in both cases am pretty much the highest non-official result.

So, 3hgroup, please prove to us once and for all that you are a profit-generating company that is "enhancing communication between people globally" (guffaw), and not a lame vanity project for a guy who got lucky with a dating site. No pun intended.
