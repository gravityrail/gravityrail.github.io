  content: ! "I don't get why people think this is a silly invention.\r\n\r\nPeople
    go camping for different reasons. Some go to experience deprivation, the great
    outdoors up their arse-crack and shivering through chilly nights in inadequate
    sleeping bags. Some go to have a nice time and relax.\r\n\r\nUp here 'camping'
    means going to a spot on the Murray, which you can't swim in, to sit and watch
    it. Some people sit with a fishing rod in their hands. I went camping last week
    with a bunch of yobs, lovely people, salt of the earth, shoot the head off a rabbit
    at 200m as much as look at it, who sat three rows deep in their LandCrusher with
    the engine idling so they could watch DVDs while they smoked bongs.\r\n\r\nAnd
    they looked like they were having a great time.\r\n\r\nPersonally if I were doing
    that kind of camping I'd love it if I could kick back with an Ipod-Hat and watch
    a couple of episodes of Buffy or something."

Hey honey, let's hit the great outdoors this weekend, huh? How about it? Imagine! The dirt under your feet, the wind whistling through the trees, and an iPhone suspended 10 inches from your face.
