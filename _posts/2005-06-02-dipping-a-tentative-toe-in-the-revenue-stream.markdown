  content: Does it bother you that they appear in the top right corner of the page,
    hiding the actual content, in Explorer?

  content: ! "Fixed! I also moved the ad to the left side to correspond to Google's
    recommended \"hotspots\".\r\n\r\nThanks for that - I hadn't bothered to check
    it in IE yet."

  content: ! "They still hide content, and it's not just IE, I'm using firefox.  My
    window's about 800px wide.\r\nAren't you able to integrate it into your current
    layout?"

  content: Geez - 800px? I'm sorry, I made a deliberate decision not to support the
    Commodore 64 when I upgraded my site.

  content: ! "heheh, I'm not running at 800x600, I just like to have small browser
    windows.  especially when viewing a site where the content area is a roughly 500px
    wide column.\r\n\r\nIt's all fixed now, so that's good"

Hot on the heels of my <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2005/05/24/a-constant-desperate-need-for-validation/">constant, desperate need for validation</a>, I have now fulfilled my aching, all-consuming desire for approval - Approval for Google AdSense, that is! Hopefully you've already been distracted from my worthy content by the litany of relevant ads at the top and to your right, rendered in a tasteful mint blue. Please feel free to click on them often and provide my worthy sponsors with revenue, and help to keep this valuable and selfless service to the web community running*.
