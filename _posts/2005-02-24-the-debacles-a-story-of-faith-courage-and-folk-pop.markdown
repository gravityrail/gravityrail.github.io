I play guitar/piano/vocals in a band called The Debacles. Tonight we played a gig at The Empress (Nicholson St, Nth Carlton, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) and we were pretty good. What follows is all the tracks the minidisc managed to record before it mysteriously switched off.

As well as having a grainy, unbalanced recording we have some <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/gallery/Empress2005-02-23">grainy unbalanced photographs</a>! <em>Rock</em>!
