My new job involves quite a bit of work with natural language tools which try to group, summarise or classify text fragments. I am aware that sometimes these tools produce odd results, because in the end they're not really intelligent - they're driven by statistics.

Still, it made me laugh when I had a quick play with <a href="http://labs.google.com/sets">Google Sets</a>, a tool which tries to predict additional entries for a set based on a few entries that the user supplies. I decided I would go easy on it the first time, so I gave it the following innocuous set: "hat", "handbag", "wallet", "keys".

What could possibly go wrong?

<blockquote><code><strong>Predicted Items</strong>
Wallet
Keys
Handbag
Hat
US History book
coke can empty
smokes
tits hairy
cell
shades
balls
History notebook
cell phone
lipgloss watermelon</code></blockquote>

"tits hairy"?

"<em>lipgloss watermelon</em>"<strong>??</strong>
