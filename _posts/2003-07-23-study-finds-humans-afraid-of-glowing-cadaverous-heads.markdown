Let's face it, if you were to pick the field of science that could wipe out humanity in the coolest way, it has to be robotics. <br />
<br />
Some <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,9830,999711,00.html">guys</a> at the University of Reading wanted to build a robot that measures people's reactions to itself. Well, clearly this baby is optimised for generating fear:<br />
<br />

<br />
The robot is so scary that the University's ethics committee forced them to put a sign up declaring under 18's not be allowed in without an adult. A quote from the article:<br />
<blockquote>A University of Reading spokesperson said the college is confident that its policies are "successfully maintaining appropriate ethical practices for research". </blockquote>... for now. How long before someone gives in to temptation and gives it chainsaw-arms?<br />
<br />
Also:<blockquote>Morgui, which is Mandarin for Magic Ghost, cannot experience emotions</blockquote>Wow, this guy is totally set up to think fleshies are weak.
