[whistles a merry tune]

Today is the first day of my new job as a senior developer in a company, ooh, 1000 times the size of my former employer. Will I become swamped in beaurocracy? Or will I valiantly ford the raging rivers of big company politics? Or will I just do what I normally do and hope no-one sees me for what I really am worthless hopeless a fraud a fake and unloveable oh please let the agony of existence end so that I may finally be at peace?

Oh, and I sure do feel relaxed after the 0 days I took off in between my old job and new job.
