  content: ! "Dan Thanks for a great Forum.\r\n\r\nAgree that there are many good
    VoiP providers out there but Skype, PennyTel &amp; Vonage do not offer Videophone
    that replaces your home phone. \r\n\r\nI was very disappointed to see the Customer
    Service issues at voipreview.org. I too had issues and their Technical Support
    were able to resolve the dropped call issues. It was due to my Internet and the
    Modem update. It seems that Broadband Internet is better for Videophone then the
    DSL Internet provided by ACN.\r\n\r\nYesterday ACN announced that their IRIS 3000
    Videophone will be released in July 2008. Preliminary info is available at http:&#47;&#47;www.getvideophone.com&#47;index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=84&amp;Itemid=131\r\n\r\nIt
    is still unclear if the IRIS 3000 will be able to call videophones from other
    providers. The big difference with this model is a bigger 7\" screen and Videomail
    capabilities. More details to follow in July."

  content: ! "How to regain legitimacy in a debate:\r\n\r\n1. Compliment the other
    speaker (\"Dan Thanks for a great Forum\")\r\n\r\n2. Give a little ground but
    not too much (\"I too had issues and their Technical Support were able to resolve
    the dropped call issues\")\r\n\r\n3. Change the subject (\"Yesterday ACN announced
    that their IRIS 3000 Videophone will be released in July 2008\").\r\n\r\nAmazing.
    It's like it came straight out of a textbook.\r\n\r\nIs there a textbook on this
    stuff? If so I'd like to buy it. I'm pretty sure the Scientologists have tried
    to pull the same tricks on me before.\r\n\r\nThese guys are a much slicker operation
    than the Meegos mob (3hgroup). 3hgroup tried to anonymously discredit me or sway
    the argument using very ham-handed tactics like posting under multiple identities
    (but the same IP address - duh!), whereas ACN obviously know quite a bit about
    marketing and negotiation&#47;game theory.\r\n\r\nI'm probably out of my depth.
    We'll see."

    about how he responded to you. Oops... look I did it to. Compliment you on your
    post... wow, I must be trying to manipulate the argument. And then to throw Scientology
    into it? A bit intelectually off center, don't you think?\r\nI am interested in
    knowing if the Iris 3000 supports other protocals. In fact I found this forum
    because I was looking ot see if there was any way for me to use Skype video to
    call a video phone, and not just another Skype user. Any information would be
    helpful... thanks! (and lay off attacking others, just provide information, it
    gives you greater credibility... just look at our presidential race for guidance)"

    and have to agree with matsonian about the manner&#47;tone in which you required
    acknowledgement of&#47;for yourself in a prescribed manner and yet could not return
    the favour.\r\n\r\nReeking with sarcasm and cynicism, why is it so hard to allow
    Ravi his freedom to be an entrepreneur (obviously) for his business?\r\n\r\nAnd
    there is always a prescribed manner in which one does things in their work regardless
    of what type of work, employment, career that person has... wouldnt you agree?\r\n\r\nLife

  content: ! "Thanks Matsonian &amp; Ellie.\r\n\r\nDan, you maybe correct in your
    assessment of the Videophone not being revolutionary in the context of technology.
    However consider that it is revolutionary in that most homes with analog phones
    are able to cut their monthly cost and move to a digital phone which also allows
    them to see the person they are talking to.\r\n\r\nMatsonian have you tried calling
    a IRIS 3000 videophone from Skype? I can provide you with my Videophone number
    if you want to try.\r\n\r\nI do not have the specs for the IRIS 3000. I do have
    the user manual http:&#47;&#47;www.myacncanada.ca&#47;documents&#47;iris3000_userguide_en.pdf"

    really worked very well, I was reluctant but \r\ncompelled to try the ACN Iris
    3000 video phone.  To my \r\nsurprise this video phone actually worked great!
    \ The video \r\nquality and sound sync is dependent on a high speed internet \r\nconnection.
    \ But, if you are video calling another ACN video \r\nphone and both parties have
    a 2MB or faster connection, \r\nthe quality is simply amazing!\r\n\r\nThanks for

  content: ! "Thanks Ravi.  We at ACN are trying very hard to win your business.  I
    too had customer service issues that were quickly resolved.  I dropped ACN's broadband
    and went with Comcast.  Problem solved!  I ended up canceling my DirecTV package
    at the same time.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we as sales reps are not given much in
    the way of technical specs.  However, there is a group of reps trying to reverse
    engineer the phone to create an open source firmware.  This firmware would allow
    connecting to other protocols.  So far the process has been a little slow, but
    when they get it done, it will be a much more versatile piece of equipment.\r\n\r\nStay
    tuned!"

  content: My spouse purchased ACN video phone from a cousin. Nothing but problems
    from the get go. It took weeks and many phone calls to customer service. Had to
    give them credit card info about 4 different times. Finally received the phone.
    Then a second one arrived. Refused to receive the second one and had FedEx return
    to sender. Now got a bill from ACN for the second (returned) phone that says we
    owe them for early termination plus the phone was damaged during return so we
    have to pay cost of phone. Big scam if you ask me! Planning on reporting to Connecticut
    Attorney General as fraudulent practices.

  content: ! "Read this and think about it !!!!!! IMHO these guys won't last long.
    This is my documentation of my experience\r\n\r\nMay 19, 2009\r\n\r\nACN  Executive
    Escalation Team\r\n  \r\nAfter dealing with your company for well over a month
    and experiencing  what I consider to be the worst  customer service I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve
    ever received and substantial fraudulent misrepresentation of the facts, there
    is absolutely no way I want to continue and affiliation or arrangement with your
    company. Simple fact is that your company cannot provide the service committed
    to via your independent contracto and customer service, making any contractual
    obligation null and void.\r\n\r\nLet&acirc;&euro;&trade;s start with the lack
    of professionalism in your customer service area. While I tried to communicate
    common sense and asked for explanation all I received is a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;collection
    agency&acirc;&euro;\x9D mentality and no offer of resolution to the problems presented.\r\n\r\n1)\tMy
    first issue is with the agency relationship you have with your independent contractors.
    Your customer service premise is that &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m
    screwed because everything is stated on the web site&acirc;&euro;\x9D. Here is
    the first comedy. Your agent ( who has no fault in this) was directed to contact
    customer service to confirm the details of your international calling plan ( specifically
    Germany). On speaker, your customer service department stated that all calls to
    Germany would apply to the 300 minutes, regardless of  number called. At no time
    was I directed by anyone to check a web site for disclosure, so how can the premise
    of your customer service department be valid.  In fact your customer service department
    offered that &acirc;&euro;&oelig;customer service and sales are two different
    areas&acirc;&euro;\x9D I asked &acirc;&euro;&oelig;if it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    the same company&acirc;&euro;\x9D? I did not receive an answer to that question.
    \r\n2)\tIn no way other than our trial and error ( with expense) did we find out
    that the information provided to us about initial set up and ongoing performance
    is adverse to some popular network environments. Your tech support told us after
    completing crashing our home office network that the Netgear routers are not compatible
    with your ACN system and we can have the continued enjoyment of discontinued conversations
    after 15 minutes.This has caused &acirc;&euro;&oelig;down time&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    expense and total frustration. This product was presented as a plug and play and
    it is most certainly not. Is that disclosure on some web site we were not directed
    to as well?\r\n3)\tYour customer service is so lacking in its facilitation of
    customer satisfaction or dispute resolution that it cannot be trusted.  Let&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    start with this e-mail received this morning, which caused me to call in this
    morning:\r\n_____________________________________________________________\r\nYour
    ACN account is currently past due in the amount of $84.14. \r\n\r\nWe have attempted
    to contact you regarding payment for your ACN Digital Phone Service. At this time,
    all of the services on your account have been temporarily suspended. To avoid
    having all of your services permanently disconnected, please update your credit
    card information by logging into your account at www.myacn.com. \r\n\r\nYour prompt
    attention to this matter will ensure continued service. The ACN Customer Portal
    is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 day a year. Your portal username
    has been included in this email.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that if your services
    are disconnected, you will be subject to third party collections for any balances
    due including, but not limited to, applicable Early Termination Fees and any unpaid
    equipment balances.\r\n\r\nIf needed, you can access information regarding how
    to read your bill by clicking here.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your business and for
    being a part of the growing family of ACN customers. \r\n\r\nACN Account Management
    Group\r\n___________________________________________________________\r\nAt no
    time did I receive any advanced notice of this problem and after checking the
    problems were not at this end. That is when I called customer service and received
    attitude and the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;collection agency&acirc;&euro;\x9D mentality.
    Your customer service department could not even access the screen that would have
    allowed her to validate what I was communicating to her. The card on file was
    valid and open without restriction. Then I asked for information on the billing
    and that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s when your customer service department fell short
    and once again set aside the contractual obligations of your company. \r\nI offered
    to pay the amount we committed to without paying the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;oh by
    the way&acirc;&euro;\x9D outrageous $.31 per minute. That is when our philosophy
    of customer service collided &acirc;&euro;&brvbar;&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;I was told
    that what I gave her was not an adequate response or action. OK&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;..so
    it comes down to your company dismissing a customer with a legitimate argument
    or complaint. \r\n\r\nHere is the part that should scare you the most&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;I
    was told after disclosing to her your inability to provide service and your misrepresentation
    that it was my problem &acirc;&euro;&oelig; because it was on the ACN web site&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have the time or inclination to train your staff or
    agents on contractual obligations, misrepresentations or applied customer service.
    That is your problem and you have a substantial one. The service agent could not
    even grasp the concept that you could not honor your contractual obligations and
    your product and services were fraudulently represented.\r\n\r\nThen I asked to
    be transferred to a supervisor, which was a complete waste of time, as the resulting
    conversation continued to demonstrate the lack of facilitation and execution that
    supervisory positions should have.  I went over the entire process and comedy
    of errors and asked  if she could provide me with resolution or at least execute
    within the terms of the service contract  and of course the answer was &acirc;&euro;&oelig;
    pay the outstanding balance of  $84.14. After consistent affirmations that the
    problems were inherent to your organization and no my fault, I was told that it
    was my problem and there was nothing she could do. I asked to have the contract
    terminated and the phone returned and that is when I was told to contact your
    department via fax. Of course, no direct contact is provided, as someone at ACN
    may have to be accountable.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I do not want to continue a
    relationship that was mis- represented form the onset. Tell me how to return the
    faulty equipment and how to terminate the contract that you are unable to service.\r\n\r\nI
    want to end it here and now and if you want to take it to the next level with
    threats of fees, billings and collections over $40.00, I have no problem seeing
    you in a Hawaii court and telling my story to thousands of people that may want
    to avoid finding themselves in my position."

  content: ! "Hi Aussie Guy,\r\n\r\nI don't understand your argument. Are you saying
    a monopoly and a pyramid scheme are the same sort of thing? They're not. And what
    does that have to do with them having ups and downs?\r\n\r\nThe case I made in
    these posts (and backed up by so many others in the comments) is that ACN is a
    company that profits from pure growth of members, not from providing a superior
    service and growing the number of customers. And also that ACN engages in deceptive
    marketing practices to sell potential recruits a false hope of building their
    fortune through the ACN program. \r\n\r\nIt has also become apparent that ACN
    has a terrible customer service mentality. Telstra has their problems, but they
    also provide the best mobile and broadband coverage in Australia, and have a huge
    R&D lab, provide thousands of actual paying jobs with a real wage, etc. Can ACN
    really say that?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDan"

    every call is on record. You would think after this many problems they would just
    let me go and waive the early termination fee.  Hell no! They are not an honest
    or ethical company!

  content: ! "Just some background on myself before i start,\r\n\r\nI'm an afterhours
    technical support consultant for numerous customers around central western NSW
    australia, i see problems from all companies telstra, iinet, ozemail, westnet,
    etc..... the list is endless.... however the release of the IRIS 3000 Video phone
    in our area is giving me so much work its crasy,\r\n\r\nOut of the box its supposed
    to work without to much problems, its a matter of plugging in the ethernet and
    power chord as per the instructions, however this is not the case...\r\na majority
    of calls require routers to have ports unblocked and forwarded that is not documented
    anywhere however after various calls to acn technical support on my clients behalf
    i still have un-rectified problems,  if your an acn customer i have even had acn
    techs suggest other companies broadband connections in order to be able to cope
    with the amout of bandwidth that the iris 3000 requires,\r\n\r\n- The IRIS 3000
    requires a minimum of 256kb&#47;s upload, even putting it down to 128kb&#47;s
    upload on the phone,doesnt make a difference on a 256k upload connection, the
    video image is generally pixilated and the speech is delayed and unclear, it drops
    out randomly,\r\n\r\ni also had similar issues on a 24mb download 1mb upload connection
    however the image was cleared on the recievers end, but speech was still impaired\r\n\r\nall
    my experience from acn reps and customers that i deal with on a daily basis, is
    going towards ACN being close to a cult more then a company, i have heard reps
    giving other reps pep talks on why they should stay and from even just listening
    id hate to be on the other end, it sounded like  a dog getting kicked in the nuts\r\n\r\nand
    whats more the acn video phone is a glorified version of skype in a video phone,\r\nbefore
    acn reps start replying to this post do you actually know what skype is and used
    it,\r\nbecause 99% of the reps that i deal with have been brainwashed into thinking
    its the worst thing on the planet, yeah like msn it has its problems with viruses,
    but the possibility of a computing product such a phone with digital technology
    having viruses is also closer then you think,\r\n\r\nfrom my experiences with
    acn i would never ever recommend anyone to ever purchase a product or service
    from acn, in australia their mobile and wireless broadband is also very sketchy,"

  content: ! "I've used Skype and I have a 12 month subscription (I renewed 3months
    ago).\r\n\r\nIt is really great, if I have a mic...\r\nRight now all I'm paying
    for is the privilege of having a permanent landline via skype-in which is diverted
    to my work landline.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm out and about I'm usually on the laptop and
    that has a mic. My WinMo has skype however that only works via speakerphone (headset
    works, however I never have it with me).\r\n\r\nPoint is skype is awesome if you
    have the correct equipment, a computer (mic &#47; speakers) and fast internet.
    If there was a device I could buy that only plugs into a Ethernet connection that
    didn't cost $300, that would be great.\r\n\r\nI haven't played with the ACN video
    phone yet (I'm a rep, inactive, I'm a customer (mobile)) however people I know
    who are reps have no complaints. My guess is they have decent internet connections.
    I actually ended up here after I did a Google search for SIP settings.\r\nBasically
    if you can get these you can use any VOIP soft client. At which point I still
    don't think the $30 &#47; month is good value considering calls to mobiles are
    per minute and not included, plus the $300 for that actual device... I have the
    $129 unlimited mobile plan (got to pay for 13&#47;1300&#47;1800 calls though)
    that includes 2GB data, so paying an extra $30 per month is a bit stupid (my situation
    only).\r\n\r\nMy experience with ACN customer service has always been great, however
    I think that is mostly attributed to the fact that I know more about what I want
    and the exact answer I want. I know where to look on the web site to get most
    of the info I need so when I call up I'm either verifying info or really specific
    with what I want from ACN customer support.\r\n\r\nIt'll be interesting to see
    if Skype stays alive with the current ongoing legal dispute...\r\nHopefully sooner
    rather than later Google Voice will come to Australia and I can get on that as
    all I need is a single number for people to call that then calls any of my actual
    phones. That would be awesome :)\r\n\r\n@Pixmyster: the only skitchy part of the
    acn mobile&#47;3g broadband is the the skitchiness of the Optus network... If
    you wont to avoid ACN make sure you avoid Optus and all associated re-sellers
    and that leaves you with 2 options, Telstra &amp; Vodafone&#47;Three. Vodafones
    network is also patchy so that leaves you with Telstra, which gets you an awesome
    network you have to pay through the nose for at which point I'll stick with Optus.
    Optus works where I need it to work and its a good price :)"

    relationship marketing\" are different from a legal perspective, but you actually
    haven't defined how they're <strong>different<&#47;strong>. What are the differences
    that makes one legal and the other illegal? \n\nAnd in terms of getting your initial
    outlay back, congratulations. I've started four actual real companies in the last
    year and got my initial outlay back on all of them within a couple of months -
    it only costs about $1500 in legal fees (less if you do it yourself) to start
    your own company. The advantage to me is that I am allowed to market my own product
    through channels that aren't direct contacts, i.e. billboards, Google ads, etc.
    \ ACN will not let you do that, as far as I'm aware.\n\nRegarding Pyramid vs MLM,
    various sites run by MLM fans can only come up with \"<a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.profitclinic.com&#47;MLM&#47;boobytraps&#47;pyramid_1.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">motive and attitude<&#47;a>\" as a distinction - hardly a functional
    difference, let alone a \"huge\" one, and one that is far more dependent on the
    personalities involved than the system itself.\n\nSo yes, please do define the
    difference between pyramid selling and network marketing. Put our minds to rest!\n\nDan"

  content: ! "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\n@Dan.\r\nThe difference of network marketing
    and pyramid selling is as follows:\r\n\r\nNetwork Marketing &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
    also known as MLM ('multi-level marketing'), relationship marketing and referral
    marketing, is the 21st century way for entrepreneurs to build a high income, without
    having to make huge financial investments. Most MLMs don't need any premises beyond
    a computer desk and perhaps a filing cabinet (though some may need storage space
    for product). Unlike franchises (the business opportunities of the 20th century)
    in general the upfront investment is small and training is usually free or very
    cheap. Overheads are low or non-existent, profits can be very high indeed.\r\n\r\nAt
    first glance, MLM is very similar to the pyramid schemes which have been made
    illegal in most of the West. In the pyramid, a representative pays his initial
    stake when he is recruited and is then shown how to recruit other representatives.
    Every representative recruited brings a bonus and adds to the potential residual
    income. But, if no customers are required, sooner or later the whole structure
    will collapse, because there is nowhere for the income to come from. In pyramid
    schemes, the people at the top are the only ones who can make money, because there
    is a limited pool of potential recruits, and no other source of income. It's pretty
    obvious that no company can survive for long without any customers.\r\n\r\nIn
    a pyramid scheme, your place in the matrix is fixed. You cannot overtake your
    sponsor. Even if they do nothing after recruiting you, they will still make more
    money than you.\r\nIn MLM, nobody makes any money until there is a sale: the company's
    income derives from its customers, and so does the income of the company's representatives.\r\n\r\n-In
    a pyramid scheme, you are paid bonuses for recruiting other representatives, regardless
    of whether or not they achieve any sales or gain any customers. Because there
    is no income to the company, sooner or later this scheme will collapse.\r\n\r\nFYI
    i am also an ACN rep. and customer and i have no complains. Like any other company
    when its searched on the internet you will find the good, the bad, and the stupid.
    Thats life. \r\n\r\nHave a great day!"

    teams of all the major providers such as Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T,

  content: ! "Yes indeed, because I'm sure the contract says \"we will turn your family
    against you\".\r\n\r\nThere is a distinction between \"legal framework\" and \"operating
    practices\". What's more it's quite clear from my direct interaction with a salesperson
    that ACN exploits the naivete and aspirations of potential resellers. \r\n\r\nMost
    people aren't capable of understanding a complex legal agreement, let alone all
    the ramifications. Particularly people who haven't been in business before.\r\n\r\nTherefore
    it is incumbent upon ACN to operate ethically, or upon the government to stop
    them from doing business. This is why ACN was investigated by the Australian Telecommunications
    Industry Ombudsman for potential violations of the Trade Practices Act because
    they were behaving like a pyramid scheme. \r\n\r\nSay what you like about the
    fact that ACN avoided conviction - they don't investigate for nothing. As far
    as I can tell both customers and resellers have nothing but complaints, or at
    least apathy, towards ACN's service."

    I have cancelled my service  and outrageous termination fees  just to be rid of
    them. One of the phones was never activated. The numerous hours spent trying to
    get this system in place was exhausting.  Then  to have my service cut off twice
    for no reason along with my computer put me over the top. This was an expensive
    lesson that I will not do again. They even took possession of my phone number
    I have had for 27 years and now it's gone thrown back into a pool without any
    notification that that would be done.  I will take responsibility for not doing
    the homeowork and going on blind faith from a recommendation. The customer service
    department are robots reading scripts mostly.  I don't think they have their service
    orientation when they continue to take full advantage of their clients with ridiculous
    fees. I'm glad to be rid of them.

    the web site and why is ACN just saying our partner UMEC? and not the full name
    of the company, I find this deceptive too. No doubt it is most likely made in
    some hell hole conditions in China or Taiwan or South Korea. So once again we
    pay way too much for a product that was probably made for a buck and paid some
    poor soul barely enough to live on, so ACN reps can get "rich" F*%K free trade

    we fought them for years and now we are firmly in bed with a Govt that could turn
    around tomorrow and do another Tiananmen Sq. massacre whenever they feel like
    it, if they decide this little free trade venture didn't work for them..Keep on
    buying cheap outsourced goods made by slaves so we can all have a better life,

  content: ! 'Sorry for bringing back the death. I just wanted to add what I think
    about this phone. First from a technical point of view this phone uses standard
    techniques: SIP and the H.264 video protocols, which are all open source as was
    already mentioned. SIP should be an open communication platform but ACN locks
    his users and charges for something that is not more expensive with other SIP
    provides that are open. It makes no sense to have SIP account with ACN when I
    can''t contact any other SIP users. Why should I do that? The technology is the
    same.. well I was able to log into the phone and throw out all ACN settings. This
    one post above about "reverse engineering" is a bit of joke. The phone works ok
    with a asterisk SIP server. Did not try it with sipgate,etc. though'
---
In the comments of my previous post, Ravi Nayar writes:

<blockquote>To clarify on above, ACN&acirc;&euro;&trade;s IRIS 2000 Videophone supports calling any phone number in the world. What makes it special is that there is no long Distance charges to call USA, Canada & Puerto Rico. Furthermore later in 2008 when ACN launches the Videophone in Europe there will be no Long Distance Charges to call Videophones in Europe from North America.

The IRIS 2000 Videophone supports analog phone equipment. You can plug your current home phone into the IRIS 2000. This allows you to have extensions throughout your home to work.

The IRIS 2000 Videophone are made in South Korea.<&#47;blockquote>

So effectively the IRIS 2000 video phone is a standard VoIP phone with standard H.263 (i.e. previous generation) video, and not the revolutionary piece of equipment touted by ACN. 

What's not clear from Ravi's comment is whether the IRIS 2000 supports calling other video phones that use the same protocols. Such capabilities would expose ACN to direct competition, but at least then the ACN would be slightly useful. 

Finally, Ravi says that the lack of long distance charges are what makes the ACN video phone "special". But it also happens to be what makes Skype-Out "special", PennyTel "special", Vonage "special", etc etc.

You can find a reasonably complete list of VoIP providers reviewed at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.voipreview.org&#47;review.all.aspx">voipreview.org<&#47;a>.

Note that ACN is not exactly near the top, and only ranks 3 stars despite obvious attempts by ACN marketers to skew the results.
