  content: Well I sincerely hope this case is thrown out of court. Suing the ISP is
    the intellectual equivalent of suing a car company because their make of car was
    involved in a bank heist, or suing the phone company because the heist was planned
    using their phone system. iiNet's stance is perfectly sensible- take the infringers
    to court, not the providers.

  content: ! 'I absolutely agree. This whole thing is a total farce. It''s like suing
    an electricity company because someone plugged a computer into a domestic socket
    that was used to download illegal porn.


    Or, more pertinently, suing Telstra because criminals used a phone to organise
    a crime.


    The government is just using this as a convenient (but horribly repressive and
    burdensome for ISPs) shortcut to real law enforcement.'

  content: ! "Precisely. Normal users wouldn't believe how many of these damn infringement
    notices the ISPs get. It would have, quite literally, added 50% to the staffing
    requirements at my old company to 'process' them. The ISP itself has no way to
    verify the claims made by the third parties and arguably doesn't have the legal
    right to monitor packets in that way even if they could. \r\nSo what action, precisely,
    are they supposed to take? Disconnect or suspend a user based on outside commercial
    (not law enforcement) claims? How then do they fight the lawsuits from the users?
    As for somehow preventing it that can't be done on the protocol level it would
    have to be done on the content. Despite being impractical&#47;impossible take
    my comments on the filtering post and magnify them by a thousand. \r\nI really
    hope I haven't breached copyright in anything I have posted otherwise vodafone
    (this is from the iPhone) will be in serious trouble!"

  content: Also, and people joke about this, but seriously, what is to stop someone
    forming a company and issuing these bogus notices on the very companies that are
    proposing these measures? Since you don't need proof, can't any and all companies
    be denied internet service in this fashion? How could this system possibly work?

  content: ! "That doesn't really address the problem here. The problem is that Cease
    and Desist orders favour those with lawyers over ordinary people. So while a large
    content company could easily handle lots of C&amp;D's and would probably start
    countersuing like crazy (in order to warn anyone else who might consider tangling
    with their lawyers), ordinary folk like you and I would probably freak out at
    the legal letterhead and hide under the bed for a week.\n\nThe whole problem with
    this area is the burden of proof and the way takedowns are implemented. Big Content
    has managed to get laws in this area drafted in such a way that they can more-or-less
    able to automate the issuing of C&amp;D's and other legal papers and sites providing
    connectivity or hosting are required to take down the content until the defendant
    can prove they weren't violating copyright. \n\nReps for Big Content will argue
    that automatically sending C&amp;D's is the only way they can deal with the magnitude
    of piracy on a global scale. The question I have for them is: If you are sending
    so many legal papers that you need a RoboLawyer to process them all, <strong>is
    it really appropriate that this is a crime?<&#47;strong>\n\nCommunity attitudes
    are rapidly changing in response to technological change. People are questioning
    whether they should pay money for things that can be copied for free. Laws need
    to change to stop the RoboLawyers and harmonise these idiotic practices with how
    people really think and behave, and which things in life are really worth money."
