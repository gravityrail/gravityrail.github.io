  content: ! "My uncle died too!! He also has the same attorney and 8 million dollars!!
    What puzzled me is that he mentioned my \"uncles\" wife and kids, and the fact
    that he's a \"snr\". Now why doesn't he just let them have that inheritance??\r\nOh
    well thanks for clearing it all up for me. Good think I didn't buy that ticket
    to Africa!\r\nSteve G."
