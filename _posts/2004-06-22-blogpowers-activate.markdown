(For those who have been out of the loop, <a href="http://www.meegos.com">meegos</a> are fucktastically stupid little icon things that ninemsn is foisting on a new generation of adolescent and pseudo-adolescent schmucks eager to make up for their lack of a personality with "cool" MSN avatars. I used to think they were cute, but irrelevant. Now I'm a <a href="http://203.31.219.111/archives/2004/6/4/meegos-are-cool/">whole lot more opinionated</a>.)

I love the web, despite all its flaws (exploitation, abuse, commercial saturation, etc) and one of the things I love most is that in concert with tools like <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, it levels the playing field. Why, even a humble blog read by almost no-one can be instantly elevated to the level of "popular resource" by virtue of PageRank (tm).

So when I read this <a href="http://203.31.219.111/archives/2004/6/20/omg-a-flamewar/#comments">post</a>:
<blockquote>I&#8217;m pretty sure meego not only sounds like propaganda from MSN, but IS propaganda from MSN. Yes, sir, they must be pretty busy at the NineMSN campus (three old cardboard boxes in a dirty alleyway not far from Nine studios) if they can pay people to fail to refute arguments on blogs with, like, a dozen readers, none of whom would ever be so 12-year-old as to pay for an ugly little avatar.</blockquote>
I  immediately checked my rank on Google. Yep, I am the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=meegos&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">third relevant hit</a>. The only pages ranked above me are the official Meegos pages themselves.  I'm not blowing my own trumpet here - I <em>know</em> my page is a pile of random and irrelevant claptrap that no-one reads. The very fact that I wrote about something as lame as Meegos just proves how irrelevant it is. However, if I was the chief executive of meegos.com, I'd be very, very interested in what was posted in the first non-official meegos hit on the most popular search engine in the world. And I'd be as careful as possible to make it look like the comments I put there look like some ordinary (but passionate) individual who just <em>happens</em> to know an <a href="http://203.31.219.111/archives/2004/6/4/meegos-are-cool/">awful lot of detailed statistics</a> about the meegos user base.

Crazier things have happened.

Now, if you want your meegos for free, be sure to go to <a href="http://www.mess.be/">http://www.mess.be/</a> and download their utility to remove the blue stripes.

Check out my <a href="http://203.31.219.111/archives/2004/6/4/meegos-are-cool/">original post</a> to catch up with this increasingly hilarious topic.
