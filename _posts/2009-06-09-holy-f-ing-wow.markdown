  content: ! "We love you Dan.  You know that.  But your life does lend itself towards
    pure blind jealousy based hatred.... you do understand that don't you? :-)\r\n\r\nIn
    all seriousness, congrats.  It seems that the reality of your existinance is beginning
    to match the capabilities we knew you had...\r\n\r\nBTW, during the wee hours
    yesterday morning I was randomly thinking about a conversation we had last time
    we met, about a conceptual business analysis for online content.  I then proceeded
    to build on a couple of real-life town-planning based algorithms in regards to
    physical traffic.  \r\nI extrapolated that into a symantic layer using online
    traffic, using the linkage data to generate traffic models, prime routes, bottle-necks
    etc.  Turned out to be quite interesting, to speak in the analogy of real-life
    transit it permitted identification of traffic flows, building of bypasses and
    byroads to best optimise and ease conjestion and frustration.  Tracking end to
    end highlighted where users would migrate naturally from point a to point b, however
    because of the existing routes some would 'give up' their journey at a breakage
    point along the way.  A bypass then increased traffic movement substantially.\r\nIn
    the concept we spoke about, this would equate to following a users preferences
    and linkage between artists to identify that users that liked artist A routed
    through various links, and if they made it often bought from artist B, but along
    the chain might dislike artist C which was a key link, and thus terminate their
    journey prematurely.  A highway between the two would maximise interactivity between
    all.\r\nHard to describe in text, but remind me to flick through the graphic modelling
    sometime (which does indeed appear in the building, street, suburb, city, road
    sense) which would make more sense.... civil engineering for the virtual world.\r\n\r\nIn
    the meantime, enjoy the States as we continue to live vicariously through your
    excitement :-P"

Just got word that I'm training with Al Gore in July at the Asia-Pacific Climate Summit. Totally and utterly honoured and blown away.
