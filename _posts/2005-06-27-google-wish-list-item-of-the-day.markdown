Put an RSS subscribe button next to search results where applicable. Then let me browse my Google news feeds in a gmail-like interface, or as an additional search page like the "Desktop" page.

You could even use a local engine, like the great Google Desktop engine.

<strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://techlifeblogged.blogspot.com/">Scott</a> posted a comment with the following great advice:
<blockquote>You can actually hack Google to give yourself this feature. You need:
1. Firefox
2. The Greasemonkey extension (http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/)
3. The Annotate Google script (http://ponderer.org/annotate_google_redux)</blockquote>

Which is great for the 1% of Firefox users (who comprise around 5-20% of web users, depending on who you ask) who have Greasemonkey.

Still, that's a cool hack.
