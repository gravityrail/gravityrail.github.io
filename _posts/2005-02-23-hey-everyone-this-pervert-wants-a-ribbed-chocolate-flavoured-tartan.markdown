I feel regret and a deep sense of shame that I am completely unable to take seriously the <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/UN-refugee-chief-quits-over-sex-claims/2005/02/21/1108834690036.html">case of Ruud Lubbers</a>, the now-former head of the UN refugee agency who quit yesterday over allegations of sexual harassment. His name is just too funny.

I know, I know - I'm taking a shallow, anglo-centric view of a serious situation which has deeply affected the life of one man (and, by the sound of it, dozens of women) but some names are so funny that they present an impenetrable blockade to serious analysis. It's like watching SBS World News presented by Cumfukya Butthole.
