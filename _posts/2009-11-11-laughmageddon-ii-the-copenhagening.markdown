Over the last few months I've been gradually putting together a new comedy show. This will be my biggest ever, at a huge two-story venue at Trades Hall, Melbourne.

Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you: <a href="http://www.laughmageddon.com">Laughmageddon II: The Copenhagening</a>.

Fundamentally, it's a bunch of top comics performing standup and a version of Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth", in madcap, tag-team style. Expect music, sketch, animation, stand-up, surprise guests and more.

Here's the details:

<strong>When</strong>: Friday, 20th November, 8pm

<strong>Where</strong>: "New Council Chambers", Trades Hall, cnr Victoria Street and Lygon Street, Melbourne

<strong>How Much</strong>: Tickets are $25 full-price, $15 concession. All proceeds donated to the Australian Conservation Foundation for their "<a href="http://www.acfonline.org.au/articles/news.asp?news_id=2313">Road to Copenhagen</a>" campaign.
<p style="text-align: left;">For tickets and more information, head to the web site: <a href="http://www.laughmageddon.com">http://www.laughmageddon.com</a>.</p>
