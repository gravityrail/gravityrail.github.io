The world came one step closer to the holy grail of enslavement by machines today, with the announcement that we can now produce <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/03/1059849278131.html">electricity from human blood</a>. I for one welcome this new age of robot domination, and beg that my life be spared so I can become a snivelling, toadying cybernetic Uncle Tom.
