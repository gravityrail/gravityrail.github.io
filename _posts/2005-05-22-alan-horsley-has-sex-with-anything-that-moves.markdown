I really just don't know what to think. This <a href="http://www.newshounds.us/2005/05/06/bizarre_sex_habits_of_the_extreme_rightwing.php">has to be a set up</a>, it just has to.

Neal Horsely, anti-abortion activist and anti-homosexual campaigner whose "outing" of doctors who perform abortions has resulted in at least one murder, admits he has had sex with horses and men on the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/alancolmesradio/">Alan Colmes show</a>.

The point he's trying to make is that we're all born in sin, and that he has found redemption for these actions through God, but his argument that we all grow up desiring sex with animals and men is a little hard to swallow.
