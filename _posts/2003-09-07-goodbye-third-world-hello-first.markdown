It's 4:50 on a humid and cloudy Sunday afternoon, and I:m sitting in an Internet cafe (more of a library/bookshop/cafe). The keyboard in front of me looks like it fell through a time-warp from the future, where all keys have four or five functions ) or, alternatively, from the past - see C64 keyboard for details). It's been a while since I've posted, because a lot's been happening and I haven't had a lot of time to write. Today's post will be lacklustre, due to excessive partying last night. Here's a rundown of the last few days.<br />
<br />
Wednesday afternoon<br />
Spent entire afternoon on beach. Bought a photocopied version of Nick Hornby's "High Fidelity" from a guy who was walking past with a huge box of books. Drank cocktails, ate like kings, etc.<br />
<br />
Thursday<br />
My first and last full day in Nha Trang. We had booked a boat trip the previous night (with Mark and Sarah, a lovely couple of Aussie doctors who we met in Hoi An). The bus picked us up at the hotel at 8am, and we "enjoyed" a greasy egg-and-bacon breakfast at the travel agency.<br />
<br />
The boat trip took us around four islands, whose names I can't remember. The first was for snorkelling around the coral. Unfortunately, due to wanton stealing and damaging of the reef (some of which occurred by the tour operators while we were there), the coral was less than impressive. The fish, too were in short supply compared to other boat trips our companions had been on (in Indonesia or the Gold Coast, for example). <br />
<br />
We stopped for lunch at the second island. We were served a smorgasboard of seafood and vegetables. Afterwards, the crew grabbed some instruments and sang a bunch of English-language and Vietnamese songs. <br />
<br />
Ugh. That's all I can be bothered writing for now.
