I recorded this song a few months ago. It was a second attempt after I tried to sing way too loud in the first. Turns out good microphones are sensitive, and good singers are supposed to know that :)

Also, that's (Brent Strahan)[https://www.facebook.com/brent.strahan] guitar-soloing over the piano solo. International collaboration!
