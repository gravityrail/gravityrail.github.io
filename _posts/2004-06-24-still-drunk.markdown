Possibly a little less afraid than I ought to be, I searched google groups to see if anyone from <a href="http://www.3hgroup.com">3hgroup</a> has ever had a problem with their Microsoft-only software. Lo and behold! The newsgroups are full of questions from one Samuel Goldenbaum (see his bio on <a href="http://http://www.3hgroup.com/appage.htm">this page</a>). Sam is <em>so</em> proficient at "architecting n-tier web applications" that he has to ask:

<blockquote>Hi All

I have a images directory: www.website1.com/images/
The website is hosted in country A but the majority of users are in country
B. My problem is image related. I want the users in country B to access the
website in country A, but pull images from a server in country B.

If I change the content location of the images directory on server A to
redirect to a URL on another server (server B), will the client pull the
content directly from the redirected URL (server B) or will the content be
pulled to server A then delivered to the client.

Thanks,

S</blockquote>

So he wants to know, in essence, how he can serve images from a different server through his website. Word to the wise, Sam - change the fucking URL.

This is becoming quite enjoyable. I think I just found my winter hobby.
