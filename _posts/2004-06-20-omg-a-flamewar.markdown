  content: I'm pretty sure meego not only sounds like propaganda from MSN, but IS
    propaganda from MSN. Yes, sir, they must be pretty busy at the NineMSN campus
    (three old cardboard boxes in a dirty alleyway not far from Nine studios) if they
    can pay people to fail to refute arguments on blogs with, like, a dozen readers,
    none of whom would ever be so 12-year-old as to pay for an ugly little avatar.

  content: Sarcasm noted, however if you go to Google and type "meegos", my post comes
    up as link number 4. It doesn't matter whether people read my blog regularly or
    not - anyone searching for Meegos using Google (i.e. the vast majority of searches)
    is _definately_ going to see that link. Therefore it's immediately important to
    MSN, and moreso to meegos.com. Very very important.

  content: Oh, and by the way, by "vast majority of searches" I of course meant "searches
    for meegos". I think we're unlikely to see our stripy cartoon friends in the Google
    Zeitgeist anytime soon ;-)

  content: Oh! And I just discovered there's a utility to remove the stripes from
    Meegos at http://www.mess.be/. Rock on!

Someone started a flamewar on my site. Check it <a href="http://203.31.219.111/archives/2004/6/4/meegos-are-cool/">out</a>! That's the last time I write a post that contains a popular google keyword.

Oh, and butts porn sluts whores schoolgirl cum paris hilton.

Just so you know.
