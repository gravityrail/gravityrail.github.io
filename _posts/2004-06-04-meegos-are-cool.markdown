  content: Yes my friend you are a smuck.... 1/. how does this not fit in a messenger
    window? funny how people with no job but to knock everyone else think that they
    have authority in many topics that are internet related...  My learned friend,
    the Meegos product is being rolled out into Australia, New Zealand all of Asia
    and Europe with msn messenger...so someone thinks its a good idea and they obviously
    have more say in matters of importance than you.. oh and yes in 3 months there
    are over 100,000 memebrs to Meegos... so its not only microsoft that dont agree
    with the stuff you write at your pc in your pj's, its the target demographic....
    any more advice champ?

  content: if you new anything about the workings of messenger you would know that
    the tabs get rotated every month...the month before the meegos tab was at the
    top and next month my bet is it will be in the middle of the page...

  content: ! "Meego, what I love most about your posts is not how much they resemble
    paid MSN propaganda, but how utterly backwards your arguments are. \r\n\r\nYou
    claim I have no authority to criticise meegos because I don't know anything about
    them, yet incorrectly assert that I have no job and that I wrote that post in
    my PJs. \r\n\r\nYou also claim that I knock everything else. I praise plenty of
    things, I just knock stuff that I happen to think is a complete waste of time
    and money, or shameless exploitation etc. And the idea that just because someone
    has say-so means that everything they do is a good idea is not just logically
    wrong, it's downright dangerous! To take some extreme examples:\r\n\r\n- Hitler
    thought invading the rest of Europe was a good idea, and had the say-so to authorise
    it.\r\n- Microsoft thought Microsoft Bob was a good idea (and invested millions
    of dollars in it), and it's universally laughed at as one of the worst ideas ever.\r\n\r\nOkay,
    so the tabs in messenger are rotated every month. And how is that not a workaround
    for an utterly farcical design flaw? YOU CAN'T SCROLL THE WINDOW TO SEE THE MISSING
    TABS! You have to resize it. Do you have any idea how many users of Microsoft
    Windows simply don't know how to resize a window? Trust me - and I've been working
    in IT support for many years (yes, I _do_ have a job) - A LOT.\r\n\r\nMeegos is,
    IMNSHO, destined for a laughable failure. You cannot sell something that has no
    intrinsic value, and in a marketplace such as the internet - where meego-type
    characters are available for free from a thousand bored graphic design students'
    websites - people will quickly catch on and forget that you were ever able to
    create boring, samey cartoons in some ninemsn backwater.\r\n\r\nI mean, duh!"

    anything else on the web. I think Amazon.com sells a lot of great books. Now,
    if they just tried to sell pictures of the covers so you could put it on your
    web site, I'd think that was insufferably lame.\r\n\r\nI wasn't saying that meegos.com

  content: ! "To Meegos Rock:\r\nJeez, you would think that maybe, just maybe, the
    wonderful people of MSN and 3H Group would have BOARDED THE FUCKING CLUE-TRAIN
    AND REALISED I CAN SEE WHO YOU ARE WHEN YOU POST ON MY SITE. But noooo, here we
    go again, this time you're posting from jetstream.xtra.co.nz, xtra being an MSN
    network that, wonder-of-wonders, just launched Meegos. Before all this started,
    I would have given such circumstantial evidence less credence, but since every
    positive comment about Meegos so far has provably come from a 3H Group employee,
    I'm no longer so trusting.\r\n\r\nAs my friend Matt said in another comment, anyone
    who googles you, be they potential partners, employees, or customers, is now going
    to see yet another pathetic attempt at marketing your virtual non-product on my
    site. MY SITE.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment you called me a \"smuck\" (sic), you invited
    this trouble on yourself. Every time you fuck with my site, you only make it worse
    for yourselves. But instead of learning your lesson, you've created at least four
    identities, astroturfed my site, called me an idiot, a 'smuck', jobless, underdressed,
    and other names. And you've bragged about your personal fortune!\r\n\r\nTalk about
    needing to get a life. If I was an employee of 3H Group, I'd jump ship right about
    now - if they're reduced to these sorts of actions, things must be really desperate."

  content: ! "Chrusiel,\r\n\r\nI know it must seem ludicrous, but for 3H Group this
    is not for the sake of a few pictures - this is their business. This is about
    marketing, money, and public perception.  No one really cares about little cartoony
    pictures - that was my original point! - but people who've invested hundreds of
    thousands of dollars in creating a new business that sells those pictures, they
    care a _lot_ about sites just like this one. Particularly when it comes time to
    gather investors for a new venture.\r\n\r\nMy site is the first non-official hit
    on google when you search for 3hgroup or Meegos. Try to think of just _one_ person
    who doesn't use Google for all their searching. I can't.\r\n\r\nImagine a company
    comes to you asking you to invest in their new venture. The first thing you do
    - the very first thing! - is find out about their previous ventures. 3hgroup have
    had just one venture - Meegos - and they've skewered their own public perception
    by engaging in guerilla marketing tactics on my blog, just because it has a high
    rank in the google search for Meegos. \r\n\r\nIn the end, this has backfired on
    them quite spectacularly, and so it should. I've made it my hobby for the last
    couple of weeks to track activities on this site, and it has been _infinitely_
    rewarding and educational. I'd like to thank Daniel Haigh and 3H Group for opening
    my eyes to the infinite stupidity of which dot-com throwbacks are capable."

    also wonders how they're still in business, given that they've produced two web
    pages in almost four years (http://www.kangasoft.com/portfolio.cfm).
    And these are the best they've got? My friends at Uni in 1997 had slicker looking

  content: ! "To Kirk Goblin.\r\n\r\nOh my GOD! You're ONTO ME! I thought I was perfectly
    safe posting my personal opinions on this web site which I OWN, whose name registration
    is under MY NAME AND BILLING ADDRESS. Why, only the most devious black hat hackers
    working for trillionaire Russian crime syndicates could figure out MY identity!
    Only they possess the mysical power of \"whois.net\".\r\n\r\nSecond, you're saying
    that that just because MSN paid a lot of money for this project I should _respect_
    them? That's exactly why I _don't_ respect them! It's L-A-M-E.\r\n\r\nThird, I
    didn't steal the Meego on my site. The Meego was part of a screenshot of the MSN
    Meegos site, which I was reviewing for editorial purposes. If MSN sues everyone
    who looks at their site and attempts to comment on it, then they're not going
    to find a lot of people reviewing their site, are they? Plus, if I had a Meego
    _without_ blue lines, and hadn't paid for it, _that_ would be stealing. This is
    the free one, ce?\r\n\r\nFinally, (FINALLY!), \"or else\". I don't even know where
    to start. But I'll start here: You're in fucking Oslo. OSLO. If you throw a snowball
    at me, it will melt by the time it gets here. I strongly doubt that you actually
    have anything to do with MSN, but just in case you do, please get back to me with
    a real threat within my legal jurisdiction and then I will take you seriously.\r\n\r\nLooking
    forward to it,\r\nDan"

  content: ! "How absolutely extraordinary, Becky. I am blown away by your arguments
    - you clearly went to the George W. Bush School of Logic and Reason. \r\n\r\nAssuming
    that you aren't a 3hgroup shill, let's consider your arguments. Allow me to paraphrase:\r\n\r\n\"Normal
    Meegos aren't worth the time or money. Animated Meegos are genius, because they
    are making a lot of money. It is also genius because it's ridiculous that they
    make that money.\"\r\n\r\nYou assume that they're making a lot of money. You haven't
    backed that up, so I have no idea if it's true or not. But if they are, you're
    right, it _is_ ridiculous. But then things get really interesting...\r\n\r\n\"They
    shouldn't be free because this person is selling their idea, and if you gave it
    away free it would be stealing.\"\r\n\r\nUm... sorry to break it to you, but NOBODY
    owns the idea of an animation, and if I wanted to give away a bunch of animations
    tomorrow that I had created, I could, and it would be completely legal. I would
    not be stealing anything from anyone.\r\n\r\nFinally:\r\n\r\n\"If you came up
    with this idea and were making money off it you wouldn't want it to be free would
    you?\"\r\n\r\nActually, that would probably never happen to me, because I wouldn't
    try to sell something that wasn't of ANY REAL VALUE. Assuming I was, then if someone
    can create that item for virtually zero cost, I was never going to do well in
    that business anyway, was I? This is the same problem that Microsoft is having
    with Linux. It's almost free to download and install, because it's just a stream
    of bytes. Being forced to pay for widely distributed identical sets of information
    in the Internet age is quickly becoming an anachronism, because the costs of production
    per unit are tending towards zero.\r\n\r\nGo back to school, dolt."

  content: I think Meegos are cool but I would never even consider buying one of them.
    to me they are worth nothing. but to some people, having a little cartoon that
    makes faces while you are talking is worth $3 or whatever it is. think about it;
    as far as I know there is not a "purpose" other than looking cool, for a necklace
    or braclet. The only reason people buy them is because they are 'cool.' in other
    words, they serve no purpose. same with meegos, It may be a worthless stupid Idea
    (I think it is) but if people think its worth there $3, let 'em buy 'em. as for
    me, I will never buy a meego.

    Do you ever feel like she's INSIDE YOUR MIND?\r\n\r\nLet me give you a counter
    example: If everyone was handing out free, custom-made bracelets on every corner,
    and you bought an inferior bracelet that was stamped out by a machine, you would
    look like a big, fat, hopeless douche.\r\n\r\nSure, it may be worth $3 to some
    people, but those people are unimaginative twats and hopefully there's as few
    of them in a world as possible.\r\n\r\nI think I've made myself clear."

At least, they're trying desperately to be cool. The latest <a href="http://ninemsn.meegos.com">cartoony gimmick </a>integrated into MSN Messenger in Australia is doomed to certain failure for one simple reason: they don't appear in the MSN main window at its default size. Observe:

Merry game of spot the meegos anyone? Their tab is off the bottom of the screen.

Anyway, my point wasn't how stupid the GUI and marketing people involved with Messenger are. Lord knows that topic deserves a blog of its own. I went to the Meegos site, and it seems that their strategy to make money is to charge you to create little cartoony pictures of yourself with their unresponsive and artistically restrictive interface. But even <em>that's</em> not the stupidest thing. The stupidest thing is, they PROVIDE YOU WITH A REALTIME PREVIEW OF THE PICTURE. Okay, so it's got a couple of stripes through it... all we need to do is make the blue stripes cool!

So, without further ado, let's start making the blue stripes cool.

Of course, their home page also provides you with a real-time preview of all the clothes too, so anyone who's handy with a paint tool can make their own meegos from the artwork on the site.

WHO THE HELL THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?

Now someone will go and prove me wrong by telling me how many schmucks have actually bought these things.
