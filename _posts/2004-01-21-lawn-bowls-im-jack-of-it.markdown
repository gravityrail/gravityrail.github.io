So this afternoon, the entire company went lawn bowling. No, it wasn't some kind of anachronistic insurrection, agonizingly raising an arthritic middle finger at upper management. Rather, it was a sanctioned social event intended to build a team atmosphere. Me being me, I was way to competitive and certainly made more people hate me than if I'd just stayed behind. 

On our team was Gordon, who said "Sweet" ALL THE TIME and bowled like he was on PCP but was otherwise really cool, and Leila and Jackie, who seemed nice.

I feel happy to have spent an afternoon in the last sun of summer.
