  content: So that's who Captain Hook is! I thought he was a glam rock band from the
    70s.

Cuddling my nephew to sleep. He kept waking up to say things, ask questions or look around. A few minutes passed and I thought he'd finally nodded off (and I was almost asleep myself).

Tap tap tap on my cheek from a tiny finger.

"Helloooo?", he asks.

"What's up?"

"Captain Hook is a pirate who is missing a hand on one arm and instead of a hand he has a hook and he uses the hook to grab things and he holds his sword in his other hand."

"Uh, thanks"

"You're welcome"

And with that, he finally went to sleep.
