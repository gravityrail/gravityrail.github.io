In a recent post, <a href="http://no-sword.sieve.net">Matt</a>'s blog wisely pointed us to the <a href="http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/english/2003.htm">Bulwer-Lytton Awards</a>, granted to the most "impressive" openings to imaginary novels. I loved this one:<blockquote>Colin grabbed the switchgear and slammed the spritely Vauxhall Vixen into a lower gear as he screamed through the roundabout heading toward the familiar pink rowhouse in Puking-On-The-Wold, his mind filled with the image of his comely Olive, dressed in some lacy underthing, waiting on the couch with only a smile and a cucumber sandwich, hoping that his lunch hour would provide sufficient time for both a naughty little romp and a digestive biscuit.</blockquote>It reminds me of everything my Dad would love in a novel. If he ever read them.
