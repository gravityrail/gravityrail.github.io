It's amazing how far spammers will stretch the English language in order to get around filters (typically, they take a standard message and then slightly randomise the message for each recipient, so that mass-spam filters don't pick up that it's the same content).

However, it's started to result in advertising that sounds somewhat less appealing than "Get a more powerful erection". I received this one today:

<blockquote>Make bangg in your unit</blockquote>

Ow!

Almost as painful sounding, the link in the email went to "www.jamitup.biz". I think they may have finally given up on the concept of sex being pleasing the cock-recipient*. Perhaps they should get together with online marketers of KY and register www.slideitin.com...

<p style="font-size: 60%;">* I was going to say "female", but then I didn't want to alienate dirty faggots.</p>
