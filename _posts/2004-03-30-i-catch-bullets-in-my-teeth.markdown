It's almost a shame that this <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001173">nice little summary</a> of modern double-speak comes from an America-hating pinko liberal.

Summary: If you say the opposite of the truth often enough the media must treat it as a topic of debate or risk appearing biased, and so formerly obvious facts are called into question.
