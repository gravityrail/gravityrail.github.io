One of the funniest things I saw last festival was a song by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.bedroomphilosopher.com">The Bedroom Philosopher<&#47;a> called "I work in New Media". It completely deflated the hyped-up bubble of "new media" language-mangling and revealed that, ultimately, none of us can describe what we do, let alone in 140 characters or less.

Well, someone <strong>has<&#47;strong> finally described what we do. And it's horrifying. And it's hilarious.

<div class="youtube-video"><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;v&#47;ZKCdexz5RQ8&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&feature=player_embedded&fs=1"> <&#47;param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"> <&#47;param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"> <&#47;param><embed src="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;v&#47;ZKCdexz5RQ8&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&feature=player_embedded&fs=1" type="application&#47;x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="425" height="344"> <&#47;embed><&#47;object><&#47;div>

To my clients: Don't take this the wrong way...
