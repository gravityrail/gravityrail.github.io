I really do really like this quote from my friend <a href="http://no-sword.sieve.net">Matt</a>.

<blockquote>"I've fixed my self-esteem problem. I realised it wasn't me I hated, it was everything else."</blockquote>

When prompted for more words of wisdom, Matt produced this:

<blockquote>"Dan Wellesley, a computer programmer who lives in Melbourne, is a big fat loser and he smells of sour milk"</blockquote>

Which left me feeling so inspired that I had to pen the following, truly a universal truth that will echo through the ages:

<blockquote>"Matt Tumpeter, an Australian living in Berlin in East Germany while teaching Latin to sidewalks,  is a ham-panted nancy-boy who turns tricks for cash and his ass looks like a rustic barn with the door swung open."</blockquote>

The Internet: a haven for intellectuals.

<strong>Update: </strong>And his web site is still down! <em>Zing</em>!
