The more observant among you may soon wonder why the quality of my photos has suddenly improved. This is because FOR THE ENTIRE TRIP SINCE THE VERY FREAKING START I HAVE HAD MY CAMERA IN LOW-QUALITY MODE for some reason I can't fathom (but which I strongly suspect is my own stupidity).

On the bright side, I was able to fit LOADS of them onto a single memory card.

Bah!
