    Life</a>, the computer game.


    Well, it''s more a free-ranging virtual world than a computer game. It''s quite
    cool in some ways, horrifically unusable in others. It''s often held up as an
    example of the increasing sophistication and open-endedness of "virtual" experiences.
    I don''t know... I''m not really a fan of increasing realism in games any more.
    If we want something really real, we have reality for that.


    Although one cool thing: In Second Life, you can fly. That''s pretty awesome.'

My 73-year-old Mum tearfully but forcefully asking <a href="http://rushkoff.com/">Douglas Rushkoff</a> whether Second Life might be a stupid distraction from our real lives. This was during his <a href="http://pbsdigitalnation.org">Digital Nation</a> round-table.

Mum is awesome. Here she is hugging a copyright-violating bear.
