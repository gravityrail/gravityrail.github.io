If a search engine doesn't think its own name is relevant to itself, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cuil.com&#47;search?q=cuil">that's just plain sad<&#47;a>.

<a href="http:&#47;&#47;cuil.com">Cuil<&#47;a> is billed as a "potential competitor to Google". Unfortunately it sucks.

I'm pretty sure when you type Google into Google it returns Google.
