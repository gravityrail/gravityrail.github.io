  content: ! "Hello, Sir!\r\n\r\nThis is a bit random, but I'm a big fan of Planet
    Nerd - and I'm making my first ever jazz/theatre/music/art/comedy
    pilgrimage from Sydney to Melbourne during the first week of September with a
    mate of mine. :)\r\n\r\nI know you do a fair few gigs here and there and I was
    just wondering if you had anything on around then that I might come along to -
    in the way of music/impro/comedy etc..?\r\n\r\nI plan to gorge myself
    on what Melbourne has to offer in the way of 'arts' in general, so I figured I'd
    ask. Tr&Atilde;&copy;s excited... it's going to be an EPIC ROAD TRIP, fyi.\r\n\r\nWoo!"
