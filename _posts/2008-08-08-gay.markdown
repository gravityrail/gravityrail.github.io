Is the BBC getting ruder? I mean, I realise on some level they're competing with Fox News, but... is this necessary?

Headline: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;news.bbc.co.uk&#47;sport2&#47;hi&#47;olympics&#47;athletics&#47;7548819.stm">Injury eased Olympic nerves - Gay<&#47;a>

They're just one exclamation mark away from discrimination. Go BBC!
