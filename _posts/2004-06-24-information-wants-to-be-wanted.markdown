  content: ! "What, were you _drunk_ when you posted this? Your comment was posted
    from inside the 3hgroup private network. Please stop spamming and abusing my site.
    This is turning into an embarrassment for you and your employer.\r\n\r\nI mean,
    really, don't you guys have better things to do? Like run a business? You can't
    really blame me for flaming you - you definately started this. From your first
    post you called me an idiot, and now you've drawn hundreds and hundreds of hits
    to my site with your pointless rants and ill-conceived attempts at marketing.
    If this post is some attempt to bait me, it failed. Frankly, I'm bored with this,
    as I'm sure anyone else would be by now.\r\n\r\nYou dug your hole, now lie in
    it. Sheesh.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDan"

  content: ! "HAHAHAHA!! NICE ALIAS, 3H GROUP! Dan's right, you're just digging the
    hole deeper. We all know that you guys no longer answer to anyone who actually
    knows anything about the internet (or much else) 00 no, you're in the Money Room
    now. And that's fine. I want in there myself. Money is great, you can use it to
    travel to all kinds of fantastic, hospitable and permissive places, like North
    Thailand and South Thailand and other parts of Thailand. BUT. If you're in the
    IT industry, you have to have people working under you who DO have a clue. And
    if you keep this up, eventually word will get out. Someone working for you will
    idly search for his employer or his current project on Google, and find you making
    a complete fool of yourself. Then they will laugh, and laugh, and laugh, but only
    when your back is turned. \r\n\r\nLike Dan said a long time ago, this site is
    a toy. Your site is your job. Dan and his friends, we're sharp, but we bore easily.
    If you stop posting, we'll eventually forget all about you. (Google never will,
    though.)"

According to my logs, <a href="http://www.3hgroup.com">3hgroup</a> now regularly checks my blog at 10 or 11am, daily - single-handedly increasing the traffic on my site by 25%.

The <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/6/4/meegos-are-cool">things you have to do</a> to get a regular audience...

I am now the top non-official result (3rd result) on google when you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=3hgroup&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">search for 3hgroup</a>. So here now we have a company that produces a <a href="http://www.meegos.com">single product</a> that sucks, and anyone who wants to know anything about them <em>or</em> their product will see <em>me</em> as the number-one third-party resource.

Surreal.
