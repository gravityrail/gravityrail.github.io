    riding atop a the one good idea humanity ever had: organised agriculture.'

I received this email today from my friend Dave:

<blockquote>Further fuel for your pessimistic world-view.

This morning on Nine's "Today" show they showed footage of two soldiers in Iraq- fully uniformed, with rifles etc. - and then interviewed their wives (and, in one case, children) back home. The presenter then proceeded to ask a SEVEN-YEAR-OLD CHILD:

"He looked pretty good with that gun, didn't he?"
"Yeah."
"He looked pretty in control, didn't he?"
"Yeah."

Fuck!</blockquote>

By golly the world is a screwed up place. Imagine the trouble the journalist would have gotten into if he'd said something like:

<blockquote>
"You know Mummy and Daddy love each other very much"
"Yeah."
"I bet Daddy's thinking a lot about how it would feel to have his pee-pee inside Mummy"
"Yeah."
</blockquote>

I mean, you simple <em>musn't</em> expose our <em>children</em> to <em>those</em> kinds of thoughts.

_sigh_
