As anyone who's been there will tell you, Japan is a hotbed of musical creativity. And we all know how much I like hot beds. Cough.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Matt and I recorded two songs while I was there, and I'm disgusted with myself to announce that I'm publishing them on the web.<br />
<br />
<a href="music/robo.mp3">Giant Robo</a> is a cover of a Japanese TV show theme song. It's fairly self-explanatory. Everything in Matt's house that made a noise was used in the creation of this song.<br />
<br />
<a href="music/sheepyknees.mp3">Sheepy Knees</a> is a heartfelt ballad about sheep that can also be thought of as a metaphor for life in these violent times. When the whole world seems to be at war with itself, can we do any less than be fellated by sheep?<br />
<br />
If you don't listen to these songs, then the terrorists have already won.
