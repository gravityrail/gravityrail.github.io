1984, the book, has warped my brain. Now I see newspeak and revisionist history everywhere. <a href="http://dear_raed.blogspot.com/2003_10_01_dear_raed_archive.html#106650061856020147">This post</a> on <a href="http://dear_raed.blogspot.com/">"Where Is Raed?"</a> talks about how in Iraq, the interim government is timing major events to coincide with old Saddam-endorsed holidays (<a href="http://vancouver.indymedia.org/news/2003/10/74378.php">Al-Zahf Al-Kabir</a>). From the post:

<blockquote>It is going to be very difficult to make people really just ignore the 7th of april or the 17th of july, all your life these dates have been engraved on your skull from the inside, so the best thing to do is give them new meanings, new reasons to celebrate.</blockquote>

They should totally do that with <a href="http://www.melbournemoombafestival.com.au/">Moomba</a>.
