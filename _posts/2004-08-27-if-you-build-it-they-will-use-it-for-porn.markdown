  content: As young Jedi Matt has found and commented, it is a Live Journal friend-only
    affair. One needs a LJ account to read it.  As much as it was originally against
    my freedom of speech principles to make it thusly, the wicked nature of scorned
    MrMe's ex-partners forced my hand.

  content: ! "Remember that episode of The Simpsons, the look on Homer's face when
    the agent is saying \"So, for the last time, when I stamp your foot and say 'Hello
    Mister Thompson', you say 'Hello'. HELLO MISTER THOMPSON!\". Homer: \"I think
    he's talking to you\".\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've got that look on my face right now.\r\n\r\nSo
    what's happening with you, anyhow? From all reports you're a cheerleader for the
    Boston Red Sox who hand-sews red leather slings for Matthew Barney's infamous
    \"Tower Of Foam\" Parties.\r\n\r\nFeel free to email me at goldsounds@gmail.com
    if you would prefer to continue this conversation away from my blog :-)\r\n\r\nDan"

<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ethan/">Ethan Zuckerman</a> is the man responsible for <a href="http://www.geekcorps.org/">GeekCorps</a>, and he has a few things to say to the world's bloggers in <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/001098.html">this article</a>.

<blockquote>Which raises the question, "In a world full of serious problems, what is this medium that we've created actually good for?"</blockquote>

Answer: It's almost preternaturally suited to distributing porn.

He raises some really good points: the vast majority of bloggers write from a rich, western, technocratic viewpoint. However, as the medium evolves and global wireless telecommunications really takes off (think backpack-satellite-comms-enabled gear available cheaply and widely), I do believe we'll see some really interesting guerilla journalism start to occur in the so-called "blogosphere".

Or, guerilla porn.

Wait, <a href="http://www.bettydodson.com/nakedcapitalists.htm">that's already happened</a>.

(uh, and on the flipside, there's also <a href="http://sd.essortment.com/theguerillag_rhgt.htm">this</a>. Guerilla Anti-Porn)
