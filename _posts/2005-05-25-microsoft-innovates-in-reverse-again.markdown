    America... the rest of the world doesn't exist...

Over the last couple years, Microsoft has burnt boatloads of cash to become "Google with a different colour scheme", by following Google's lead and releasing copycat products a few months after the Google versions (<a href="http://search.msn.com">simplified search engine</a>, <a href="http://desktop.msn.com">desktop search</a>). Now they're about to do it again with <a href="http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/050523-125208">MSN Virtual Earth</a>, a mapping service with many conspicuous <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google-Maps</a>-esque features such as overlaying popups on the map and dynamic zooming.

Online mapping services are not a new idea, but Google was the first to make a compelling map browsing  engine that runs in any modern browser with no plugins required.

In related news, Keyhole is to be renamed "Google Earth". Let the conspiracy theories begin!
