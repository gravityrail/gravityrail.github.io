I get excited every time someone writes about me. 

I met Sarah Jansen at the downstairs bar during <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.brizimprovfest.com&#47;">Brisbane Improv Festival<&#47;a>. She was quite lovely and, it turns out, an arts writer. And she <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sarahjansen.com&#47;2007&#47;06&#47;brizimprovfest_interviews_impro_musos.html">wrote about me<&#47;a>. Thanks Sarah!
