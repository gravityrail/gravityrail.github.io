A great deal of hullabaloo and huffery-puffery has been generated between the WTO (i.e. the USA) and China over China's failure to crack down on the production of counterfeit goods.

Until now, I never paid much notice. Who cares if China feeds the poor by selling fake designer handbags and copies of Windows XP?

It's a counterfeit Disneyland. Their slogan? "Because Disneyland is too far". I'm not making this up.

You've got to admire that level of commitment.
