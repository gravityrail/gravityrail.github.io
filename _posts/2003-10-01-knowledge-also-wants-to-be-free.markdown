True to their long tradition of acting all superior and uppity, MIT has arrogantly published all of their course notes so that anyone in the world with access to the Internet (and sophisticated mastery of the English language, and boundless self-motivation) can learn how to, for example,  make chemical weapons. Click <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html">here</a> and become so much more interesting at parties. Does the Department of Homeland Security know about this? (On the other hand, why break the long and noble tradition of training your future enemies?)
