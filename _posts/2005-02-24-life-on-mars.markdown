I am watching the ABC's <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/default.htm">Catalyst</a> program right now, and there's <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s1310280.htm">a segment</a> on their science show about the discovery of (bacterial) life on Mars. It looks plausible - something to do with fluctuating Methane and Formaldehyde levels in the atmosphere. If the team behind the discovery are correct, then it will radically change the way humans see themselves.

It's going to be officially announced in a few hours at the <a href="http://television.esa.int/default.cfm#">European Space Agency symposeum</a> (link goes to ESA television, a broadcast of the symposeum report).

Go science!
