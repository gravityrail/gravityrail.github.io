Donald Trump took one step closer to turning into a complete caricature of himself today, when he said that if the Freedom Tower design was built on the former World Trade Center site, "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4560441.stm">the terrorists have won</a>". In playing the terrorism card, he joins such activist luminaries as:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.prwatch.org/node/2578">Pro-lifers</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/features/1151647">Martha Stewart, fans of <em>Ghost Recon</em>, Rev. Calvin Butts, etc</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.fuzrocks.com/terrorists/index.html">Random bloggers</a></li>
</ul>

Mr. Trump is backing a project to build twin towers almost identical to the original Trade Center design, but one floor higher. As far as I can tell, this will have two effects: It will make the towers slightly more unstable, and slightly easier to hit with a plane.

Way to go.
