    really wish I wouldn't respond? Have you noticed a pattern forming here? I ignore
    you and get on with my life, you post some insulting comment, and I ream you out
    and go back to my life again.  There's a pattern forming here and there's a very
    simple way to stop it - STOP POSTING ON MY SITE.\r\nThanks,\r\nDan"

I sometimes fantasise about the things I would do if I were rich. Don't we all? You could do anything. Travel all the places you ever wanted to go and have money left over for a nice house and an easy life, working whatever jobs you find the most fulfilling. But one thing I never picture myself doing is <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/6/27/two-a-meegos/#comment-142">posting comments on people's blogs asking if they're jealous of my fortune yet</a>.

<blockquote>jealous fucker?</blockquote>

(for those that are out of the loop, a company called <a href="http://www.3hgroup.com">3H Group</a> has been attempting to promote their <a href="http://ninemsn.meegos.com">Meegos</a> product <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/6/23/sorry-i-was-pretty-far-off-the-mark/">on my site</a>, almost exclusively through <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/6/4/meegos-are-cool/">childish name-calling and "astroturfing"</a>. Despite repeatedly showing them that I can track their identity through their IP address, they still post from inside their corporate intranet. The kicker is that I'm now the top result from Google when you search for their company <em>or</em> their product.)

I don't understand, really I don't. What does Daniel Haigh (a director of 3H Group) stand to gain from doing this? Does he find it personally satisfying to get the last word (even if it is "fucker") about how wealthy and successful he is?

I must confess that a get a buzz every time someone posts to my site from that IP. It means I can write more content about 3H Group, which means a higher Google PageRank(tm) on that search, which means more chance that everyone searching for those involved in this ridiculous debacle will see what a coven of cockspanks they are.

<strong>update!</strong> if you check the <a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/7/21/no-fucking-way/#comments">comments</a> for this post, you'll see that the original poster (and, let's face it, I have no way of knowing that it's Daniel Haigh or not, but it's someone who works for him so what's the difference?) has some advice for me:
<blockquote>No comments, waste of time, stop talking about people you don&#8217;t know please</blockquote>
Aww, diddums. This from the person who labelled me a jobless smuck (sic)  in his very first post on this site!

Whose time is this wasting exactly? And if I'm "wasting my time", then why do you keep wasting yours trying to respond?
