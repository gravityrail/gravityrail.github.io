<div class="annoyed">

Oh boy, I'm really annoyed (Everyone: "How annoyed?"). I'm so annoyed that I'm creating a new CSS class just to express it.

It looks like the Australian Labour Party is <a href="http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,10331442%255E462,00.html">set to pass</a> the <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/new/fta/australia.htm">FTA legislation</a>. Among the FTA's many aims is the "harmonisation" of Australian copyright and Intellectual Property (whatever that is) laws with those of the USA.

The Senate's <a href="http://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/negotiations/us_fta/economic_analysis_report/summary.html">own analysis</a> expects a <em>whopping</em> 0.7% increase in projected GDP over the next decade as a result of passing this legislation.

<h1> <blink>WOW!</blink> </h1>

And what are the other costs of this legislation, to generate this <em>tremendous</em> boost to Australia's economy?
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.arnnet.com.au/index.php/id;1223868977;fp;4;fpid;1976458394">Sweeping new powers</a> to copyright holders will create a massive legal burden to ISPs</li>
	<li>The government's own papers <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/rp/2003-04/04rp14.htm">highlight the negative impact</a> on local industries and consumers of new Intellectual Property provisions in the FTA</li>
	<li>Major US environmental protection organisations are convinced the agreement will have a <a href="http://www.melbourne.indymedia.org/news/2004/01/60181.php">negative impact on the environment</a>.</li>
</ul>

and so on.

This sucks. Particularly if<a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/freetrade_ctte/submissions/sub446.pdf"> you use and support Open Source software</a>. Check out more well-reasoned complaints <a href="http://www.tradewatchoz.org/AUSFTA/Index.html">here</a>.

Time to move to Brazil.

<strong>update</strong>: The Sydney Morning Herald has <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/08/06/1091732077487.html">posted a piece</a> explaining why the AUS-FTA may destroy the software industry in Australia.
