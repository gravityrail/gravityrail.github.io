Sorry I haven't written for a while. I have been staying in Internet-free houses near Twyford while visiting my Granny. She is on her last legs (you should see all the legs she's gone through, there's cupboards full of them) and so it has been a very sad time. My aunts and uncles are all visiting at various times, and I am leaving for Edinburgh tomorrow. Probably back in a few weeks for the funeral.

In the meantime, am spending today touring around London. I only have 6 minutes left on this Internet terminal, so I must go. Soon, I will be amongst comedy and friends. A good time to recharge the batteries.
