Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person who can forsee the upcoming three-way war between humans, robots and half-robot monkeys. Has the world gone mad?<br />
<br />
First we create <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994263">martial-arts robots</a>, then we start <a href="http://news.mc.duke.edu/news/article.php?id=7100&index=1">giving monkeys robot arms</a>. I mean, are these people sleep-researching? WAKE UP! YOU'LL DESTROY US ALL!<br />
