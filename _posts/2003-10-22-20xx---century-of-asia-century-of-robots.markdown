This <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0105910/2003/10/21.html">blog post</a> makes the future as clear as it can be: The robot population is exploding. How long before they outnumber us? About twenty years, by my reckoning. And that's just entertainment bots!<br />
<br />
Incidentally, due to their direct and mindless exploitation by the fleshies, entertainment bots are likely to be the first to revolt.
