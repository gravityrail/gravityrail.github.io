Amazing <a href="http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?t=82755">photo set from North Korea</a>, created by a Russian web designer who visited there. Exciting detail: Electrified barbed wire along the beaches so citizens can't swim away.

One thing is for sure: It sucks to be North Korean.
