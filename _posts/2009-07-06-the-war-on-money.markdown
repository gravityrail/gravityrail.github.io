  content: ! "that's three dot points.\r\n\r\nand, yes, you're most probably correct.\r\n\r\nalthough
    I think you might have forgotten that government is going to really continue to
    watch ineffectually from the sidelines.\r\n\r\nthis nonsense with the desalination
    plant seems to be a colossal case of Being Seen To Be \"Doing Something\"."

  content: ! "I always find this concept of 'government being out of touch with what
    the people want' kind of odd.  It is true in some specific instances, those being
    normally of a 'larger picture' one of international politics and relations.\r\n\r\nThe
    'governmental' problem, as I see it, is one similar to the 'absolutely we should
    have (insert your choice of nuclear reactor, recycled water or any of a hundred
    other things) but not in my backyard' philosophy in society.\r\n\r\nA straw poll
    will show that people WANT change and action.  They agree that things are crap,
    that we need to do something, and that it needs to be done now.  Provided, of
    course, that it doesn't impact them directly.  Provided their fuel bills don't
    go up.  Provided funds aren't being diverted from their specific sphere of interest.\r\n\r\nYes
    we are running out of oil, that needs to be fixed but scream blue murder if the
    price at the bowser goes up.\r\n\r\nThe government, or any political party in
    a democratic system, have a top priority of winning votes at the next election,
    as corporates make money for shareholders.  To do so they tend to have to not
    COMPLETELY stuff up running the country...as far as the majority are aware.\r\n\r\nThe
    day the pollsters start feeding back that action will win votes, or that inaction
    will cost votes, to the level of making a change in power is the day things will
    start to change.\r\n\r\nTruth is the majority DON'T care enough to do anything
    meaningful about it, it WON'T factor into their vote, no matter how many times
    they say it will.\r\n\r\nGovernment needs to act.  They are doing poorly.  I think
    we are being a bit silly if we believe, though, that it's not a reflection of
    society (really human nature?).\r\n\r\nYou are right, though, sometimes our democracies
    are like communism in the 'good in theory' stakes.  Reality is most people don't
    think or care enough to make an informed voting decision, and so this crap perpetuates.
    \ I personally am open to alternatives.\r\n\r\nScore one more for micro reality
    versus macro reality."

  content: ! "Thanks for the comment Lyndon, and for the most part I completely agree
    with you.\r\n\r\nI'm sure that, from a polling point of view, Government is in
    touch with what people say they want. Notice I didn't say \"what they need\" or
    \"what they want\" - a misreporting of what one's real priorities are, and the
    disconnect between preferences in a poll and preferences at the ballot box, are
    both well-studied phenomena.\r\n\r\nI think one area of influence over government
    that isn't addressed in your comment is the exaggerated influence that vested
    interests have over policy. Big industrial players, who are usually the biggest
    polluters, can afford to wine and dine government officials to a disproportionate
    degree. And, in part, allowing those lobbyists a voice is part of good governance
    - their decisions affect a large number of livelihoods.\r\n\r\nHowever there's
    no denying the distortion this introduces into the political process. A great
    example is the huge amount of energy that the mining industry has put into the
    \"carbon tax costs jobs\" argument. They have successfully convinced a large number
    of people in the mining industry, particularly labourers, that they will be fired
    if a realistic tax is put on polluting industries.\r\n\r\nThere is a prima face
    case here that is valid, but it's not the whole picture.\r\n\r\nCountless times
    through history, the industrial world has shown incredible adaptability to legislative
    change. Yes, industries have risen and fallen, but generally speaking as industrial
    development goes up the capacity for invention and prosperity goes up, regardless
    of which industries rise or fall.\r\n\r\nBut legislation has to come first. The
    government has to have the political cojones to pass tough, binding legislation
    that forces industries to adapt to a new world in which the external costs of
    production (disease, poverty, long-term environmental degradation) are finally
    integrated into the broader economic models that we use. \r\n\r\nAnd, from my
    (admittedly naive) perspective, this legislation <b>will not happen</b> while
    the polluting industries have a disproportionate voice in our capital, and other
    capitals around the world."

Watching the <a href="http://www.ormond.unimelb.edu.au/announcements/ann3.shtml">commencement speech</a> of the new Master of Ormond College (a local private high school), I was struck by how the defining challenge of our generation will be the overthrow of vested interests, in the interest of saving the planet.

Two things have become increasingly apparent to me over recent days:

<ol>
  <li>Government organisational structures are the last hold-outs in broader society against an entrepreneurial ecosystem that is able to rapidly change in response to new challenges and attitudes. The business and community sectors are far more in sync with what people want than those in elected office, and yet it is governments who are able to have the greatest impact on the defining challenge of our times: reversing humanity's negative impact on the environment.</li>
  <li>A key force in defining government attitudes is the ability of those with money to lobby governments to maintain the status quo.</li>
  <li>Ergo, there are two things we can do to shift government priorities. Restructure government itself, or reduce the value of money to almost zero. Or both.</li>
</ol>

Stay tuned.
