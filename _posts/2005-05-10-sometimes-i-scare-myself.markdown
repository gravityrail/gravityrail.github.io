From a recent email to a friend:
<blockquote>
The great thing about all this technology is that in five years it will be invisible. Your camera will have GPS, it will talk to your computer via bluetooth, information will be sent via your mobile phone, and the only thing you have to do is point and shoot. The next thing you know, your photo album has the photo in it, you can view it on a map, you can see other people's photos from the surrounding area, you can see how the area has changed in appearance over time, etc.

Imagine a camera that is connected to the 'net via your mobile phone. There is a dial on the camera that says "time", and you wind it back to 2005 and shoot. The camera retrieves an image from the 'net taken from somewhere near that spot during 2005, and displays it on the screen. You have just taken a photo of the past.

The money is in making it invisible, and making it all connect  - that's what I hope to do.

Maybe.</blockquote>

Hey, I can dream, can't I? ;-)
