    ok I'm good.  I think I heard you mention meego's to me at one stage but just
    took it as generic unimportant babble.  That whole story link was a good read,
    I'm amused as hell.\r\n\r\nAlso, is that link to do with geo coding? or some other
    sort of meta-data? or is it just searching on post/title keywords?\r\n\r\nHowever
    it achieves it it's fairly neat from an authoring perspective.  Lets you summarize
    past content fairly effectively"

The ninth most common google search term used by people finding my page is "whitening food".

I don't even know what that is. But if it does what I think it does, it's right up there with anti-wrinkle cigarettes.

Almost every other query that ends up here is to do with "<a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/archives/2004/06/04/meegos-are-cool/">meegos</a>".

<a href="http://www.goldsounds.com/index.php?s=meegos&submit=Search">Read the whole story</a>, some parts are kind of funny.
