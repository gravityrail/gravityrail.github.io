  content: Give us more information on Laughmageddon, when/where?

As I'm gearing up for Laughmageddon, the climate change comedy event, my research continues to depress me. Sometimes rediscovering facts you already knew can hit you almost as hard as when you first heard them.<br /><br />We are currently in the midst of the 6th great extinction of species. While the "background" (or typical) rate of extinction outside great evolutionary events like the Cambrian Explosion is about 1 species per year, we are now smashing nature at around <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=The_Sixth_Great_Extinction">100 - 1000 times that rate</a>.<br /><br />Go humanity! Awesome!<br /><br />The Bible has something to teach us here. Noah's ark anyone?<br /><br /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" alt="" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=219bfff9-4d47-8426-aa9f-291d052877b1" /></div>
