I'm the CTO of [NationBuilder](http://nationbuilder.com), the world's first Community Organising System.

On the side, I write and record music and occasionally perform comedy.

Once upon a time, I created a TV show in Australia called [Planet Nerd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nerd), with some wonderful friends:

* [Ben McKenzie](http://labcoatman.com.au/)
* [Simon Barber](http://about.me/simonbarber)
* [Paul Verhoeven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Verhoeven_(Australia))
* And many more...

Full credit for this amazing Jekyll theme must got to [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes)
